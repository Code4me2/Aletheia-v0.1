# Dev CLI Modules

This directory contains modular components of the ./dev CLI script.

## ✅ Modularization Complete

All commands have been successfully extracted into focused modules.

## Module Structure

| Module | Lines | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `dev-lib.sh` | 264 | Common functions library (check_db_ready, output_result, etc.) |
| `dev-help.sh` | 99 | Help system and command documentation |
| `dev-n8n.sh` | 942 | Complete n8n automation (kept intact for branch merging) |
| `dev-services.sh` | 435 | Service management (up, down, restart, status, logs, shell) |
| `dev-db.sh` | 274 | Database operations (schema, shell, backup, restore) |
| `dev-utils.sh` | 863 | Utilities (setup, doctor, validate, rebuild, seed-users) |
| `dev-env.sh` | 172 | Environment configuration (check, list, ports) |
| `dev-docs.sh` | 246 | Documentation verification and updates |

## Architecture

```
./dev                    # Main entry point (198 lines)
  ├── Load environment   # Sources .env variables
  ├── Source modules     # Loads all dev-modules/*.sh
  └── Route commands     # Delegates to module functions

Each module exports:
  - Handler functions (handle_*_command)
  - Command implementations
  - Shared utilities via dev-lib.sh
```

## Usage

The main `dev` script sources these modules and routes commands to the appropriate handlers:

```bash
# Service management
./dev up [service]       # Handled by dev-services.sh
./dev status            # Handled by dev-services.sh

# Database operations
./dev db schema         # Handled by dev-db.sh
./dev db backup         # Handled by dev-db.sh

# Utilities
./dev setup            # Handled by dev-utils.sh
./dev doctor           # Handled by dev-utils.sh

# n8n automation
./dev n8n setup        # Handled by dev-n8n.sh
./dev n8n workflows    # Handled by dev-n8n.sh
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability** - Each module is focused on a specific domain
2. **Testability** - Individual modules can be tested independently
3. **Extensibility** - New features can be added to specific modules
4. **Collaboration** - Multiple developers can work on different modules
5. **Code Clarity** - Clear separation of concerns
6. **Easier Debugging** - Issues isolated to specific modules
7. **Branch Merging** - n8n module kept intact for easy merging

## Adding New Commands

To add a new command:

1. Choose the appropriate module or create a new one
2. Add your function to the module
3. Export the function at the end of the module
4. Add a case in the main `dev` script to route to your function

Example:
```bash
# In dev-utils.sh
my_new_command() {
    echo "Doing something useful"
}
export -f my_new_command

# In main dev script
case "$1" in
    my-command)
        my_new_command "$@"
        ;;
esac
```

## Testing

All modules support JSON output for automated testing:
```bash
./dev status --json
./dev env check --json
./dev db schema --json
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Unit tests for critical functions
- [ ] Lazy loading for faster startup
- [ ] Command completion support
- [ ] Module template generator
- [ ] Performance profiling
