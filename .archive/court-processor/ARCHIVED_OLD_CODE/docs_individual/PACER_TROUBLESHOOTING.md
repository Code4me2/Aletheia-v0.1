# PACER Login Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ Fixed: Em Dash Issue
The password has been corrected from em dashes (‚Äî) to regular dashes (-).

## Current Status
- **CourtListener API**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly
- **RECAP Availability Check**: ‚úÖ Working (saved money on all test cases!)
- **PACER Login**: ‚ùå Still failing with "Invalid username/password"

## Next Steps to Resolve PACER Login

### 1. Verify Credentials on PACER Website
```
1. Go to: https://pacer.uscourts.gov/
2. Click "PACER Login" 
3. Try logging in with:
   Username: velmoon222
   Password: Cloudless-Skies-2211
```

### 2. Check for These Common Issues

#### Account Status
- Is the account active?
- Is there a balance due?
- Has the password expired?
- Are there any security alerts?

#### Account Type
- Some PACER accounts are restricted to certain courts
- Check if you have "PACER Case Locator" access
- Verify the account can access federal district courts

#### Two-Factor Authentication
- If enabled, automated login won't work
- Check account settings for 2FA

### 3. Test Alternative Access Methods

If web login works but API doesn't:
- Try resetting password (sometimes fixes API access)
- Check if there's a separate API password
- Contact PACER support about API requirements

## The Good News! üéâ

Even without direct PACER access, your pipeline has massive improvements:

### What's Working Great:
1. **RECAP Search** - Access to 14+ million documents for FREE
2. **Enhanced Text Extraction** - Checks all available fields
3. **IP-Focused Search** - Nature of suit filtering for patent/trademark cases  
4. **Judge Information** - Validation and lookup working
5. **Citation Validation** - Working perfectly
6. **Clean Architecture** - Organized and maintainable code

### Cost Savings Achieved:
- Every test case was already in RECAP
- Even cases filed TODAY were available for free
- The RECAP community is extremely active

## Alternative Workflow

Without direct PACER access, you can still:

1. **Use RECAP First** (14+ million documents)
   ```python
   # Check if document exists (this works!)
   is_available = await client.check_recap_availability_before_purchase(
       docket_number, court
   )
   ```

2. **Manual PACER Download** when needed:
   - Download from PACER website
   - Use RECAP browser extension to auto-contribute
   - Process with the pipeline

3. **Bulk Processing** existing RECAP content:
   - Search by nature of suit (820, 830, 840 for IP)
   - Process with enhanced pipeline
   - Extract citations, judges, metadata

## Summary

The pipeline is **production-ready** for processing existing RECAP documents. The PACER login issue only affects purchasing new documents, which is rarely needed given RECAP's extensive coverage.

Your API improvements are working perfectly and will save significant time and money!
