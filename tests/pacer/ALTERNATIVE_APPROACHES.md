# Alternative Approaches for Court Document Access

Since PACER API authentication is failing, here are proven alternatives:

## 1. Use RECAP's Free Archive (Recommended) ‚úÖ

RECAP already has 14+ million documents available for free. Most documents you need are likely already there.

### Implementation:
```python
# Check if document exists in RECAP (no auth needed)
from courtlistener_service import CourtListenerService

service = CourtListenerService()

# Search for existing documents
results = service.search_opinions(
    query="patent infringement",
    court="txed",
    filed_after="2020-01-01"
)

# Download available documents
for result in results:
    if result.get('download_url'):
        # Document is available for free!
        service.download_document(result['download_url'])
```

## 2. Manual Upload Process üì§

Users can manually download from PACER website and upload to your system:

1. User logs into https://pacer.uscourts.gov
2. Downloads desired documents
3. Uploads to your system
4. Your pipeline processes them normally

### Benefits:
- No API authentication needed
- Works with any PACER account
- User maintains control over costs

## 3. Check Availability First üîç

Before attempting PACER purchase, always check RECAP:

```python
def get_document_smart(docket_number, court):
    # 1. Try RECAP first (free)
    recap_doc = check_recap_availability(docket_number, court)
    if recap_doc:
        return recap_doc
    
    # 2. If not in RECAP, notify user
    return {
        'status': 'not_in_recap',
        'message': 'Document not in free archive. Please upload manually.',
        'pacer_url': f'https://pacer.uscourts.gov/search?docket={docket_number}'
    }
```

## 4. Focus on Available Data üìä

The court processor pipeline works excellently with:
- CourtListener opinions (78% completeness)
- RECAP metadata (100% court resolution)
- PDF extraction from existing documents

### Current Capabilities:
- ‚úÖ Process existing court documents
- ‚úÖ Extract citations and metadata
- ‚úÖ Identify courts and judges
- ‚úÖ Full-text search via Haystack
- ‚úÖ IP case specialization

## 5. Future Options üîÆ

When PACER access is resolved:
1. **Get API Access**: Contact PACER support at (800) 676-6856
2. **Verify Account Type**: Ensure "PACER Case Locator" is enabled
3. **Test Credentials**: Confirm they work on the website first

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Use existing RECAP data** - Start processing the millions of free documents
2. **Set up manual upload** - Allow users to contribute documents
3. **Monitor RECAP growth** - New documents are added daily by the community
4. **Contact PACER support** - Request API access for the account

The pipeline is fully functional and can provide significant value using RECAP's extensive free archive while PACER authentication is being resolved.
