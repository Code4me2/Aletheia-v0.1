# CourtListener Transcript Download Results

## Summary

We attempted to download transcript data from CourtListener for 3 high-volume courts (Texas Eastern District, Northern District of California, and Southern District of New York) for the last 90 days.

## Key Findings

### API Access Limitations
1. **RECAP Documents Endpoint**: Permission denied - requires special access
2. **Docket Entries Endpoint**: Permission denied 
3. **Search Endpoint**: Connection issues during bulk queries
4. **Opinions Endpoint**: âœ“ Working - successfully downloaded opinion texts

### Data Retrieved
- **4 court opinions** that mention transcripts
- Total size: ~104 KB of text data
- Courts with data: CAND (2 opinions), NYSD (2 opinions)

### Content Analysis
The downloaded opinions primarily contain:
- **Protective orders** mentioning deposition transcript procedures
- **Case management orders** referencing transcript filing requirements
- **Not actual transcript content** from hearings or depositions

## Conclusions

1. **Direct transcript access requires RECAP permissions** - The CourtListener API token we have provides access to opinions and basic case data, but not to the RECAP document archive where actual transcripts are stored.

2. **Opinions rarely contain full transcript quotes** - While opinions mention transcripts, they typically don't include extensive transcript excerpts.

3. **Alternative approaches needed**:
   - Request RECAP access from CourtListener
   - Use PACER directly (requires account and fees)
   - Focus on opinions that quote testimony
   - Search for cases with public transcript releases

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Request Enhanced Access
Contact CourtListener/Free Law Project to request RECAP API access for research purposes.

### Option 2: Use Available Data
Focus on the ~8,000 search results that mention "transcript" and extract quotes and references from opinions.

### Option 3: Alternative Sources
- Look for courts that publish transcripts publicly
- Use Google Scholar for cases with transcript excerpts
- Check court websites directly for high-profile cases

## Technical Notes

The infrastructure for downloading and processing transcripts is fully built:
- Enhanced bulk download script with transcript detection
- Database schema for storing transcript documents
- Automatic categorization of transcript types
- Rate-limiting compliance

Once RECAP access is obtained, the system can immediately begin downloading actual transcript documents.
