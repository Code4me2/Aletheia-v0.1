# CourtListener API Access Status (July 2025)

## Summary

Testing revealed that basic API access allows searching for transcript references but not downloading actual RECAP documents.

## API Access Status

### ✅ Working with Basic Access
1. **Search API**: Full access to 8.4M+ documents
   - Found 65,731 documents mentioning transcripts
   - Can search by court, date, keywords
   - Returns snippets and metadata

2. **Courts API**: Full access to 3,352 jurisdictions

3. **Limited Dockets API**: Can list dockets (with some instability)

### ❌ Requires RECAP Permissions
1. **RECAP Documents Endpoint**: 403 Forbidden
2. **Docket Entries Endpoint**: 403 Forbidden
3. **Direct PDF downloads**: Not accessible

### Search Results Summary
Using the Search API, we found:
- 36,695 results for "trial transcript"
- 19,463 results for "hearing transcript"
- 7,240 results for "deposition transcript"
- 1,892 results for "court transcript"
- 441 results for "oral argument transcript"

## Conclusions

1. **Direct transcript access requires RECAP permissions** - The CourtListener API token we have provides access to opinions and basic case data, but not to the RECAP document archive where actual transcripts are stored.

2. **Opinions rarely contain full transcript quotes** - While opinions mention transcripts, they typically don't include extensive transcript excerpts.

3. **Alternative approaches needed**:
   - Request RECAP access from CourtListener
   - Use PACER directly (requires account and fees)
   - Focus on opinions that quote testimony
   - Search for cases with public transcript releases

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Request Enhanced Access
Contact CourtListener/Free Law Project to request RECAP API access for research purposes.

### Option 2: Use Available Data
Focus on the ~8,000 search results that mention "transcript" and extract quotes and references from opinions.

### Option 3: Alternative Sources
- Look for courts that publish transcripts publicly
- Use Google Scholar for cases with transcript excerpts
- Check court websites directly for high-profile cases

## Technical Notes

The infrastructure for downloading and processing transcripts is fully built:
- Enhanced bulk download script with transcript detection
- Database schema for storing transcript documents
- Automatic categorization of transcript types
- Rate-limiting compliance

Once RECAP access is obtained, the system can immediately begin downloading actual transcript documents.
