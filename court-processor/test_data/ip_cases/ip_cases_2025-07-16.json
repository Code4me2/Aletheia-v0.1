Nagala, United States District Judge.                           \n    In this insurance liability dispute, Plaintiffs Natalia Martin and Edgardo Ramos seek \npayment from Defendant Integon National Insurance Company (\u201cIntegon\u201d) for the unsatisfied \nportion of a five million dollar stipulated judgment in an underlying personal injury lawsuit.  The \nstipulated  judgment  resolved  a  car  accident  case  stemming  from  seventeen-year-old  Hugh \nIreland\u2019s collision with Plaintiff Martin, a pedestrian, while he was driving his mother\u2019s car in \nAugust of 2019.  In the ensuing state court lawsuit, Plaintiffs and Ireland ultimately stipulated to \na judgment of $4.5 million in favor of Plaintiff Martin and $500,000 in favor of Plaintiff Ramos, \nMartin\u2019s husband, for loss of companionship.                              \n    In the present case, Plaintiffs primarily contend that Integon is directly liable to them for \nthe amount awarded in the stipulated judgment, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 38a-321, because \nHugh Ireland was covered under his grandparents\u2019 insurance policy with Integon, as a resident of \ntheir household.  See Compl., ECF No. 1-1 at 4\u201312 (Count One).  Plaintiffs also alleged that \nIntegon acted in bad faith in refusing to provide insurance coverage to Hugh Ireland under the \npolicy.  Id. at 12\u201313 (Count Two).                                        \n    Integon has moved for summary judgment on both counts of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.  ECF \nNo. 34.1  As part of their opposition brief to Integon\u2019s motion, Plaintiffs withdrew Count Two.  \nThen,  following  oral  argument\u2014during  which  the  proper  disposition  of  Count  Two  was \ndiscussed\u2014Plaintiffs moved to dismiss Count Two pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(2).  ECF No. \n90.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court DENIES Integon\u2019s motion for summary judgment \n\nas to Plaintiffs\u2019 direct action claim (Count One) but GRANTS it as to Plaintiffs\u2019 bad faith claim \n(Count Two).  Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss Count Two is denied as moot.   \nI.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND2                                                  \n    A.  The Underlying Action                                            \n    As noted above, on August 1, 2019, seventeen-year-old Hugh Ireland hit Plaintiff Martin, \na pedestrian, while driving his mother\u2019s car.  Pls.\u2019 L. R. 56(a)(2) St., ECF No. 42, \u00b6\u00b6 2\u20133.  Martin \nsustained serious injuries from the accident, and she and Ramos sued Hugh Ireland in Connecticut \nSuperior Court.  Martin v. Ireland, No. FST-CV21-6052691-S (\u201cUnderlying Action\u201d).  In that \naction, the parties agreed to a stipulated judgment awarding $4,500,000 to Plaintiff Martin and \n\n$500,000 to Plaintiff Ramos.  Pls.\u2019 L. R. 56(a)(2) St. \u00b6 4.               \n    As part of the settlement agreement between the parties in the Underlying Action, Hugh \nIreland and his parents\u2014William Ireland IV and Maureen Ireland\u2014all signed affidavits of no \nexcess coverage (the \u201cAgreement Affidavits\u201d).  Id. \u00b6 22.  In his own affidavit of no excess \ncoverage, Hugh Ireland listed two residences: 39 Allen Rd. Norwalk, Connecticut 06851 (his \nmother\u2019s address) and 2 Allen Court, Norwalk, Connecticut 06851 (his paternal grandparents\u2019 \n\n\n1 Integon also filed a motion to strike an offer of compromise made by Plaintiffs.  ECF No. 56.  This motion was fully \nbriefed, and the parties were put on notice that the Court would consider it as part of the June 18, 2025, oral argument.  \nAt outset of oral argument, however, Integon withdrew this motion.  See Oral Arg. Tr., ECF No. 92, at 15\u201316.  \n2 The factual background is taken primarily from Plaintiffs\u2019 Local Rule 56(a)(2) Statement, ECF No. 42 (\u201cPls.\u2019 L.R. \n56(a)(2) St.\u201d).  The facts are undisputed, unless otherwise indicated.    \naddress).3  Id. \u00b6 31.  Hugh Ireland noted that, at the time of the accident, his father and mother \nshared custody of him, and that his father lived at 2 Allen Court with his (Hugh\u2019s) grandparents.  \nId. \u00b6 29.  William Ireland IV also stated on his affidavit that Hugh Ireland was a \u201cmember of the \nhousehold\u201d at 2 Allen Court, Norwalk, Connecticut 06815.  Id. \u00b6 25.       \n    B.  The Integon Policy                                               \n\n    Integon issued an insurance policy to Hugh Ireland\u2019s paternal grandparents, William D. \nIreland III and Jane Ireland, for the period spanning September 21, 2018, to September 21, 2019.   \nId. \u00b6 8.  This insurance policy provided auto liability coverage with bodily injury limits of $250,000 \nper person and $500,000 per accident.  Id. \u00b6 9.  Under the policy, the covered parties included the \nnamed insured policyholders, William D. Ireland III and Jane Ireland of 2 Allen Court, Norwalk, \nConnecticut 06851, and their \u201cfamily members,\u201d as well as any person using the insureds\u2019 \n\u201ccovered auto.\u201d  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 35.  Within the policy, \u201cfamily members\u201d are defined as \u201ca person related \nto [the policyholder] by blood, marriage, or adoption who is a resident of [the policyholder\u2019s] \nhousehold.\u201d  Id. \u00b6 36(F).                                                 \n\n    As part of the stipulated judgment agreement in the Underlying Action, Hugh Ireland \nassigned to Plaintiffs all of his rights to payment from Integon related to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.  Id. \u00b6 \n6.                                                                        \n    C.  Denial of Coverage Under Integon Policy                          \n    Plaintiffs requested coverage from Integon under the elder Irelands\u2019 policy.  See Compl., \nECF No. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 29\u201331.  On February 12, 2021, Integon denied coverage for bodily harm caused \nby the car accident in the Underlying Action despite Hugh Ireland\u2019s assignment of his rights of \n\n\n3 The parties do not dispute that Hugh Ireland\u2019s paternal grandparents\u2019 house address was 1 Allen Court Norwalk, \nConnecticut until approximately 2018, when the City of Norwalk changed the address to 2 Allen Court.  See Pls.\u2019 L.R. \n56(a)(2) St. \u00b6 41.  Both addresses refer to the same property.  The Court will refer to the address as 2 Allen Court in \nthis ruling.                                                              \npayment from Integon to Plaintiffs.  Pls.\u2019 L. R. 56(a)(2) St. \u00b6 133.  Integon reasoned that, based on \nits investigation, \u201cHugh Ireland was not a resident of William and Jane Ireland\u2019s household on the \ndate of loss and, therefore, he was not a \u2018family member\u2019 within the meaning of that term as defined \nin the Integon Policy\u201d; nor was Hugh Ireland driving a covered vehicle at the time of the accident.  \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 133\u201334.                                                            \n\n    The parties agree that Hugh Ireland was not driving a covered vehicle at the time of the \naccident, but they do dispute whether Hugh Ireland was a resident of his grandparents\u2019 household \nat that time.  Plaintiffs contend that, based on the affidavits Hugh Ireland and William Ireland III \nsigned in the Underlying Action, there is a dispute of fact over this central coverage issue.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n25, 31.  Integon, for its part, believes that evidence from its own investigation and later affidavits \nprovided by Jane Ireland, William Ireland III, Maureen Ireland, William Ireland IV, and Hugh \nIreland (hereafter, the \u201cIntegon Affidavits\u201d) support its determination that Hugh Ireland did not \nreside at his grandparent\u2019s home on August 1, 2019, or ever.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 38, 43\u201344, 60\u201362, 76\u201377, 80, \n95, 99, 110\u201311, 114\u201315, 124, 130\u201331.  The Integon Affidavits generally affirm that Hugh Ireland \n\nvisited his grandparents\u2019 house, but did not have a room there, did not spend the night there, did \nnot keep clothes or belongings there, and did not receive mail there.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 46\u201348, 62\u201364, 80\u201382, \n99\u2013101, 114\u201317.  In his Integon Affidavit, Hugh Ireland also affirmed that he erroneously listed \nhis grandparents\u2019 house as one of his residences on the Settlement Affidavit and that his subsequent \nstatements indicating that he did not ever reside there were accurate.  Id. \u00b6\u00b6 121\u201322.  Integon thus \ncontends that there is no genuine dispute of fact about whether Hugh Ireland is covered under his \ngrandparents\u2019 policy, and that it is thus entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 claims.  \nII.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND                                                \n    In June of 2023, while this action was assigned to U.S. District Judge Charles Haight, \nIntegon filed the present motion for summary judgment on both claims asserted by Plaintiffs.  ECF \nNo. 34.  In their opposition, Plaintiffs explicitly withdrew Count Two of their complaint, the bad \nfaith claim.  See ECF No. 41 at 4\u20135.  This withdrawal prompted Integon to file a motion to strike \n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 offer of compromise made pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 52-192a, which Plaintiffs \nopposed.  See Mot. to Strike, ECF No. 56; Opp. to Mot. to Strike, ECF No. 57.  In May of 2025, \nthe case was reassigned to the undersigned.  See Order of Transfer, ECF No. 64.   \n    The Court held oral argument on the motion for summary judgment and the motion to strike \non June 18, 2025.  During the argument, Integon withdrew its pending motion to strike Plaintiffs\u2019 \noffer of compromise.  ECF No. 92 at 15\u201316.  Additionally, the parties tentatively agreed to file a \njoint notice of voluntary dismissal, with prejudice, of Count Two, in light of Plaintiffs\u2019 withdrawal \nof that count.  Id. at 25; Order, ECF No. 89.  Despite their commitment at oral argument, the parties \nwere unable to agree on whether costs should be awarded in any stipulation of dismissal, prompting \n\na new round of briefing on Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss Count Two.  See Mot. to Dismiss, ECF \nNo. 90; Def.\u2019s Opp. to Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 93; Pls.\u2019 Reply, ECF No. 95.     \nIII.  SUMMARY JUDGMENT LEGAL STANDARD                                     \n    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a) provides, in relevant part, that a court \u201cshall grant \nsummary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and \nthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d  A disputed fact is material only where the \ndetermination of the fact might affect the outcome of the lawsuit.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., \n477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  With respect to genuineness, \u201csummary judgment will not lie if the \ndispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine,\u2019 that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury \ncould return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d  Id.                     \n    In moving for summary judgment against a party who will bear the ultimate burden of \nproof at trial, the movant\u2019s burden of establishing there is no genuine issue of material fact in \ndispute will be satisfied if the movant can point to an absence of evidence to support an essential \n\nelement of the non-moving party\u2019s claim.  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322\u201323 (1986).  \nThe movant bears an initial burden of \u201cinforming the district court of the basis for its motion, and \nidentifying  those  portions  of  \u2018the  pleadings,  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and \nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\u2019 which it believes demonstrate the absence \nof a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d  Id. at 323.  A movant, however, \u201cneed not prove a negative \nwhen it moves for summary judgment on an issue that the [non-movant] must prove at trial. It need \nonly point to an absence of proof on [the non-movant\u2019s] part, and, at that point, [the non-movant] \nmust \u2018designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u2019\u201d  Parker v. Sony \nPictures Ent., Inc., 260 F.3d 100, 111 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 324).  \n\nThe non-moving party, in order to defeat summary judgment, must come forward with evidence \nthat would be sufficient to support a jury verdict in his or her favor.  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249.  \nIf the non-movant fails \u201cto make a sufficient showing on an essential element of [their] case with \nrespect to which [they have] the burden of proof,\u201d then the movant will be entitled to judgment as \na matter of law.  Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323.                         \n    In considering a motion for summary judgment, a court \u201cmust construe the facts in the light \nmost favorable to the non-moving party and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable \ninferences against the movant.\u201d  Kee v. City of New York, 12 F.4th 150, 158 (2d Cir. 2021) (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted).  \u201cOnly when reasonable minds could not differ as to the \nimport of the evidence is summary judgment proper.\u201d  Bryant v. Maffucci, 923 F.2d 979, 982 (2d \nCir. 1991).                                                               \nIV.  COUNT ONE: DIRECT ACTION CLAIM, CONN. GEN. STAT. \u00a7 38a-321           \n    To begin, the Court denies Integon\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiffs\u2019 direct \naction claim because the Court finds a genuine dispute of material fact exists as to whether Hugh \n\nIreland was a resident of his grandparents\u2019 home at the time of the accident.   \n    Direct action claims asserted under Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 38a-321 consist of three elements: \n\u201c\u2018(1) that the plaintiff has recovered a final judgment; (2) that the judgment is against a person \nwho was insured by the defendant against liability on it; and (3) that the judgment remains \nunsatisfied.\u2019\u201d  Tucker v. Am. Int\u2019l Grp. Inc., 936 F. Supp. 2d 1, 8\u20139 (D. Conn. 2013) (quoting Skut \nv. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 142 Conn. 388, 393 (Conn. 1955)).  The parties do not dispute \nthat the first element is satisfied, as Plaintiffs have recovered a final judgment in the underlying \naction in the form of a stipulated judgment awarding Plaintiff Martin $4,500,000 in damages, \nawarding Plaintiff Ramos $500,000 in damages, and assigning them Hugh Ireland\u2019s rights of \n\npayment from Integon, should any exist.  Pls.\u2019 L. R. 56(a)(2) St. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6.  Nor do the parties dispute \nthat the judgment remains unsatisfied.  Thus, it is the second element\u2014whether Hugh Ireland was \ninsured by Integon when the accident occurred\u2014that is central to Integon\u2019s motion for summary \njudgment.                                                                 \n    As described above, the insurance policy at issue here provides coverage to the named \ninsured policyholders, William D. Ireland III and Jane Ireland, and their \u201cfamily members\u201d\u2014\ndefined as \u201ca person related to [the policyholder] by blood, marriage, or adoption who is a resident \nof [the policyholder\u2019s] household.\u201d  Id. \u00b6 36(F) (emphasis added).4  The insurance policy is \ninterpreted under the rules \u201cthat govern the construction of any written contract.\u201d  Conn. Med. Ins. \nCo. v. Kulikowski, 286 Conn. 1, 5 (Conn. 2008).  As relevant here, because the parties agree that \nthe terms of the policy are clear and unambiguous, the language of the policy must be accorded its \n\u201cnatural and ordinary meaning.\u201d  Id.                                      \n\n    Whether an individual is a resident of household for purposes of an insurance policy \ngoverned by Connecticut law involves analysis of several factors.  See GEICO Indemnity Co. v. \nDionisio, No. 3:12-CV-1137 (VLB), 2016 WL 74390, at *7 (D. Conn. Jan. 6, 2016) (citing \nRemington v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 240 Conn. 309, 315 (Conn. 1997)).  The factors considered \nare:                                                                      \n         the intent of the individual; the frequency of contact between the individual \n         and other household inhabitants; the frequency with which the individual \n         spends time at the household; the maintenance of a separate residence for \n         the individual; whether the individual is emotionally and financially capable \n         of establishing and maintaining a residence independent of the household; \n         the location of personal belongings; the location of and address used for \n         personnel and business records; the address at which mail is received; and \n         the address used for formal purposes such as voting, licenses, and income \n         tax filings.                                                    \nRemington, 240 Conn. at 315; see also Israel v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 239 F.3d 127, \n131\u201332 (2d Cir. 2000) (considering the Remington factors to assess residency for insurance \nliability purposes).  These factors are not exhaustive and any determination regarding residence \ndepends on the specific factual circumstances of a case.  Griffith v. Sec. Ins. Co., 167 Conn. 450, \n458\u201359 (Conn. 1975).  Further, an individual may be a resident at more than one address.  See \n\n4 The parties agree that Hugh Ireland is related by blood to William D. Ireland III and Jane Ireland.  See ECF No. 34 \nat 15; ECF No. 41 at 9.  Therefore, the only dispute here is whether Hugh was a resident of their household on the \ndate of the accident.                                                     \nRemington, 240 Conn. at 316 (holding that a jury charge was too narrow where it failed to instruct \nthat \u201ca person may have more than one residence\u201d).                        \n    As detailed below, the parties have provided conflicting evidence regarding Hugh Ireland\u2019s \nresidence(s) on August 1, 2019.  Thus, because a reasonable jury could find that Hugh Ireland was \na resident of his paternal grandparents\u2019 home on August 1, 2019, Integon\u2019s motion for summary \n\njudgment must be denied.                                                  \n    First, the Agreement Affidavits conflict with the Integon Affidavits on this issue, creating \na  genuine  dispute  of  material  fact.    In  the  Agreement  Affidavits,  Hugh  Ireland  listed  his \ngrandparents\u2019 residence as one of his addresses.  Pls.\u2019 L.R. 56(a)(2) St. \u00b6 31.  Additionally, William \nIreland IV\u2019s affidavit stated that Hugh Ireland was a \u201cmember of the household\u201d at Hugh\u2019s \ngrandparents\u2019 address.  Id. \u00b6 25.  In the Integon Affidavits, on the other hand, Hugh Ireland and \nWilliam Ireland IV stated that Hugh was in fact not a resident of his grandparents\u2019 home on the \ndate of the accident, and that the former statement of residency in the Settlement Affidavits was \nmade in error.5  See Pls.\u2019 L.R. 56(a)(2) St. \u00b6\u00b6  95, 110, 114, 121\u201322.  This conflict evinces a genuine \n\ndispute of material fact.                                                 \n    Second, the deposition testimony taken in this case further supports the conclusion that \nthere is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Hugh Ireland was a resident of his \ngrandparents\u2019 home on August 1, 2019.  In his deposition, Hugh Ireland stated that the two \nresidences listed on the Settlement Affidavit were listed in error and that he never resided at 2 \nAllen Court.  See Hugh Ireland Dep. Tr., ECF No. 50-3 at 20.  Integon argues that Hugh\u2019s \nrecantation of his prior statement requires the Court to find there is no genuine dispute of material \n\n\n5 For the first time in its reply brief, Integon suggests that the Settlement Affidavits are impermissible hearsay.  See \nECF No. 48 at 14.  But \u201c[a]rguments may not be made for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d  See Knipe v. Skinner, 999 \nF.2d 708, 711 (2d Cir. 1993) (collecting cases).  The Court, therefore, will not entertain a belated, obliquely-raised \nhearsay argument.                                                         \nfact.  See ECF No. 34 at 11\u201312.  But where the same witness makes conflicting statements at \ndifferent points in time, he creates a credibility dispute that must be left to a jury to resolve.  See \nMiranda v. Westover Sch., Inc., No. 22-2546-cv, 2023 WL 6307044, at *2 (2d Cir. Sept. 28, 2023) \n(summary order) (reversing district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment where a single witness \nmade potentially conflicting statements in a deposition); see also Frost v. N.Y.C. Police Dep\u2019t, 980 \n\nF.3d 231, 247\u201348 (2d Cir. 2020) (reversing district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment where a \nwitness\u2019s declaration, submitted for summary judgment, contradicted the witness\u2019s statements \nearlier in the case).                                                     \n    This is not the \u201crare circumstance where the plaintiff relies almost exclusively on his own \ntestimony, much of which is contradictory and incomplete.\u201d  Jeffreys v. City of N.Y., 426 F.3d 549, \n555 (2d Cir. 2005).  Rather, the issue is one of a witness\u2019s credibility, which makes it unsuitable \nfor resolution on summary judgment.  See Frost, 980 F.3d at 245 (noting that \u201c[i]t is a bedrock \nrule of civil procedure that a \u2018district court generally cannot grant summary judgment based on its \nassessment of the credibility of the evidence presented.\u2019\u201d (quoting Agosto v. INS, 436 U.S. 748, \n\n756 (1978)).  The jury must decide whether it believes Hugh Ireland\u2019s statement in the Settlement \nAffidavit that his grandparents\u2019 residence was one of his addresses, or his later statements that he \ndid not reside at their home.  That other deponents also testified that Hugh Ireland never lived at 2 \nAllen Court does not alter this conclusion; indeed, it only highlights the genuine factual dispute.     \n    Additionally, other  evidence in  the record presents  conflicting facts  regarding Hugh \nIreland\u2019s residency, as evaluated through the Remington factors.  On the one hand, Hugh Ireland, \nhis mother, and his grandparents all testified that he never resided at 2 Allen Court, that he would \ngo there for visits such as on Wednesday nights for a few hours and sometimes to use the pool, \nand that he could come and go as he pleased but did not have a key.  See J. Ireland Dep. Tr., ECF \nNo. 50-2, at 10:24\u201325, 11:1\u20133, 13:4\u201321, 19:19\u201322; H. Ireland Dep. Tr., ECF No. 50-3 at 9:23\u201325, \n10:1\u20135, 11:5\u201313,13:4\u201312, 20:15\u201322, 22:15\u201317; W. Ireland III Dep. Tr., ECF No. 50-4 at 9:14\u201322, \n10:17\u201319, 11:9\u201311; M. Ireland Dep. Tr., ECF No. 50-5 at 36:11\u201325, 37:16\u201321.  Hugh Ireland and \nhis mother also testified that he never spent the night at 2 Allen Court.  See ECF No. 50-3 at 21:23\u2013\n22:7;  ECF  No.  50-5  at  10:1\u20133.    But  Hugh  Ireland\u2019s  father  told  a  Progressive  Insurance \n\nrepresentative that Hugh Ireland slept at his grandparents\u2019 house five to ten percent of the time and \ndescribed Hugh\u2019s frequency of visits to his grandparents\u2019 house as \u201cconstant,\u201d noting that it was \n\u201clike an open house with my kids.\u201d  Pls.\u2019 Ex. 1, ECF No. 43-1 at 3.  Hugh Ireland\u2019s mother later \ndisputed those statements.  See ECF No. 50-5 at 35:22\u201325, 36: 1\u201310.  Additionally, Hugh Ireland \nand his mother testified that he never left any belongings at his grandparents\u2019 house, ECF No. 50-\n3 at 15:8\u201310; ECF No. 50-5 at 37:16\u201318, but Hugh Ireland\u2019s grandmother testified that he \nsometimes left a bathing suit or towel there, ECF No. 50-2 at 19:17\u201322.  Finally, Hugh Ireland, \nhis mother, and his father affirmed both in the Settlement Affidavits and in subsequent deposition \ntestimony that, at the time of the accident, his parents shared custody of Hugh Ireland, and his \n\nfather resided at 2 Allen Court.  See Pls.\u2019 L. R. 56(a)(2) St. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 25\u201326, 29, 43, 79; ECF No. 50-\n3 at 16:7\u20139; ECF No. 50-5 at 17:8\u201311.  Such conflicting material facts preclude summary \njudgment.                                                                 \n    The Court is not convinced by Integon\u2019s counterarguments.  Integon essentially seeks to \nhave the Court determine that its evidence supporting its position that Hugh Ireland did not reside \nwith his grandparents on the date of the accident is weightier than Plaintiff\u2019s evidence to the \ncontrary.  In so arguing, Integon attempts to sow doubt as to the truth of the statements in the \nAgreement Affidavits, based on alleged motivations of Hugh Ireland and his father to avoid \nliability for the significant judgment owed to the plaintiffs in the Underlying Action.  But, again, \n\u201ccredibility assessments, choices between conflicting versions of the events, and the weighing of \nevidence are matters for the jury, not the court on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d Curry v. City \nof Syracuse, 316 F.3d 324, 333 (2d. Cir. 2003) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  \nAssessing whether Hugh Ireland was a resident of his grandparents\u2019 home on August 1, 2019\u2014\nthe  material  fact  on  which  liability  turns\u2014inherently  requires  the  exact  type  of  factual \n\ndetermination that must be left to a jury, in light of the conflicting affidavits and other evidence \npresented by both parties.  See Associated Metals & Minerals Corp. v. M/V Arktis Sky, 978 F.2d \n47, 52 (2d Cir. 1992) (overruling district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment because \u201cthe \ndocumentary proof and conflicting affidavits submitted in this case create a genuine dispute of \nmaterial fact\u201d such that \u201cdefendants are not entitled at this stage of the proceeding to judgment as \na matter of law\u201d).                                                        \n    At oral argument, Integon asserted, for the first time, that this Court could disregard the \nconflicting affidavits and evidence and weigh the Remington factors itself pursuant to Dionisio, \n2016 WL 74390, and Bonilla v. Amica Mutual Ins., No. 106010810-S, 2011 WL 4347788, at *3\u2013\n\n4 (Conn. Super. Ct. Aug. 29, 2011), and that any such analysis would require the Court to grant \nsummary judgment for Integon.  See ECF No. 92 at 7\u201315.  The Court need not consider this \nargument, which was raised for the first time at oral argument.  See Dollar Phone Corp. v. Dun & \nBradstreet Corp., 559 F. App\u2019x 71, 72 (2d Cir. 2014) (affirming district court decision declining \nto address arguments raised for the first time at oral argument).  Although Integon cited Dionisio \nin its reply, it did so only to briefly distinguish its facts from those of this case and to allude to a \npossible hearsay argument.  See ECF No. 48 at 7, 14; see also supra n.5.  And Integon never \nbriefed any argument related to Bonilla.  Rather, Integon notified the Court of the existence of \nBonilla\u2014a case decided in 2011, approximately thirteen years before Integon filed its motion for \nsummary judgment in this case\u2014as part of a notice of supplemental authority filed shortly before \nthe oral argument on its motion.  See Notice, ECF No. 80; Notice, ECF No. 82.  Even then, the \nnotice of supplemental authority did not include any analysis related to the holding in Bonilla; \ninstead, it included a copy of the case with excerpts highlighted.  See ECF Nos. 80, 82.  Thus, the \nCourt declines to consider Integon\u2019s belated argument as to these cases. 6    \n\n    For these reasons, Integon\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied as to Plaintiffs\u2019 direct \nliability claim.                                                          \nV.   COUNT TWO: BAD FAITH CLAIM                                           \n    Integon\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted as to Plaintiffs\u2019 bad faith claim and \nPlaintiffs\u2019 motion for an order dismissing the bad faith claim is denied as moot. \n    As noted above, Plaintiffs explicitly withdrew Count Two in their opposition to Integon\u2019s \nmotion for summary judgment.  See ECF No. 41 at 4\u20135.  And although the parties had tentatively \nagreed at the oral argument to stipulate to dismissal of that claim with prejudice, they failed to \nreach agreement as to whether Integon should be awarded costs.  See ECF No. 90.  Thus, Plaintiff \n\nhas moved for an order of dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2).  Id. \n    Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A), a plaintiff may dismiss an action \nwithout a court order by filing \u201ca notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves either an \nanswer or a motion for summary judgment,\u201d or a stipulation signed by all parties who have \nappeared.  As Integon has filed a summary judgment motion and refuses to stipulate to dismiss \nCount  Two  on  Plaintiffs\u2019  terms,  Plaintiffs  cannot  avail  themselves  of  Rule  41(a)(1)(A)\u2019s \n\n\n6 In any event, both Dionisio and Bonilla are distinguishable from this case, as the records in those cases supported \ntheir conclusions that, under the Remington factors, there was no genuine dispute about the relevant party\u2019s residency.  \nHere, Integon did not even bother to brief the Remington factors in its opening papers.  And, for the reasons described \nabove, there is a genuine dispute about whether Hugh Ireland was a resident of his grandparents\u2019 household on the \ndate of the accident.                                                     \nprocedure.  Instead, Plaintiffs seek dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2), which allows dismissal by court \norder, \u201con terms that the court considers proper.\u201d  For the reasons discussed below, the Court \nbelieves it is appropriate to grant Integon\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Count Two, and \nthus is denies Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss that count as moot.          \n    Courts in this circuit appear to vary in their approach to a plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal of a claim \n\nas part of summary judgment briefing.  Compare, e.g., Yorzinski v. City of New York, 175 F. Supp. \n3d 69, 74 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (granting summary judgment as to withdrawn claims) with \nMalarczyk v. Lovgren, No. 1:19-CV-42, 2022 WL 374271, at *13 n.10 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2022) \n(dismissing a claim explicitly withdrawn in opposition to motion for summary judgment rather \nthan granting summary judgment).  Nonetheless, where a defendant would be prejudiced by a \nplaintiff\u2019s withdrawal of a claim at the summary judgment stage, permitting such a withdrawal \nwould neither be fair nor in the interests of justice.  See Frerck v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., No. 11-\nCV-2727, 2014 WL 3512991, at *9, n.10 (N.D. Ill. July 14, 2014) (\u201cAllowing Plaintiff to withdraw \nhis claims now\u2014at the end of discovery and while Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is \n\npending\u2014runs  counter  to  the  purpose  of  summary  judgment  and  would  unfairly  prejudice \nDefendant.  The Court rejects Plaintiff\u2019s attempt to \u2018deprive the defendant of a ruling on the \nsummary judgment motion by [his] dismissal tactic.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted) (alteration in original) \n(quoting Pace v. S. Exp. Co., 409 F.2d 331, 334 (7th Cir. 1969)).         \n    Here, Plaintiffs withdrew their bad faith claim in their opposition to Integon\u2019s motion for \nsummary judgment, in light of the statements in the Integon Affidavits.  ECF No. 41 at 4\u20135.   Under \nthese circumstances, the Court finds that granting Integon summary judgment on Count Two is \nappropriate, as permitting Plaintiffs to withdraw or dismiss this claim at this stage would unfairly \nprejudice Integon, which expended effort to litigate and brief a summary judgment motion on \nCount Two, and would permit Plaintiffs to avoid judgment on the merits via a late-breaking \ndismissal tactic.  Moreover, if successful on its motion for summary judgment, Integon would \ntypically be entitled to costs\u2014other than attorney\u2019s fees\u2014as a prevailing party.  See Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 54(d)(1).  By seeking dismissal under Rule 41 at this late stage, Plaintiffs appear to be seeking \nto avoid the possibility of paying Integon\u2019s costs as to Count Two.  Indeed, it was the parties\u2019 \n\ndispute as to whether Integon would be entitled to costs that prompted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to \ndismiss.  Whether Integon will be awarded costs will be left for another day; but it is a prevailing \nparty on Count Two given Plaintiffs\u2019 withdrawal of that count, and it should be allowed to seek \ncosts at the appropriate time.                                            \n    Thus, the Court grants Integon\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Count Two.  It further \ndenies as moot Plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss, in light of its determination that summary judgment \nas to Count Two is appropriate.  The Court declines to reach the question of whether an award of \ncosts in Integon\u2019s favor is appropriate at this time, and will leave that issue to be resolved at the \nconclusion of this litigation.                                            \n\nVI.  CONCLUSION                                                           \n    For the reasons described herein, Integon\u2019s motion for summary judgment is DENIED as \nto Plaintiffs\u2019 direct action claim (Count One), and GRANTED as to Plaintiffs\u2019 bad faith claim \n(Count Two).  Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an order dismissing Count Two is DENIED AS MOOT.  \n    The Court will convene a status conference to set dates for pretrial submissions and trial.  \n\n    SO ORDERED at Hartford, Connecticut, this 15th day of July 2025.     \n\n                               /s/ Sarala V.
