### **Testing Strategy**
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Continuous Testing**: Run tests on every change
- **Integration Testing**: Test service interactions
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark each enhancement

### **Branch Strategy**
- **Main Branch**: `feature/flp-integration-clean` (current stable)
- **Development**: `feature/enhanced-unified-processor` (active development)
- **Feature Branches**: Individual features branch from development
- **Testing**: Automated testing on all branches

### **Quality Gates**
Each phase must pass:
- All existing tests continue to pass
- New functionality is fully tested
- Code coverage maintains >80%
- Performance benchmarks meet targets
- Security scanning passes
- Documentation is updated

## Implementation Principles

### **1. Backward Compatibility**
- Existing API endpoints remain functional
- Original UnifiedDocumentProcessor continues to work
- Configuration changes are additive, not breaking
- Migration path is clear and documented

### **2. Incremental Enhancement**
- Each phase adds value independently
- Rollback is possible at any phase
- Features can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- Progressive enhancement approach

### **3. Future Extensibility**
- Plugin architecture for new processors
- Configurable pipeline stages
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- API versioning for future changes

### **4. Operational Excellence**
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Health checks and metrics
- Graceful error handling
- Performance optimization

## Success Metrics
