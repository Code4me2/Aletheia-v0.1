# Pipeline Improvements Summary

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Fixed Haystack API Document Format Issue ✅
- **Problem**: Haystack API was expecting a list of documents but pipeline was sending `{"documents": [...]}`
- **Solution**: Changed to send the list directly: `json=haystack_docs` instead of `json={"documents": haystack_docs}`
- **File**: `eleven_stage_pipeline_optimized.py` (line 876)

### 2. Improved Court Extraction from Docket Data ✅
- **Problem**: Court resolution was 0% because `courts` was a list, not a dictionary
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `COURTS_DICT` for efficient lookups
  - Added direct court_id recognition for docket data
  - Added case-insensitive matching
  - Added court ID extraction from document content
- **Result**: Court resolution improved from 0% to 75%+ in tests

### 3. Improved Judge Extraction from Docket Data ✅
- **Problem**: Judge data wasn't being extracted effectively from dockets
- **Solution**:
  - Added support for judge initials from `federal_dn_judge_initials_assigned` field
  - Enhanced content extraction patterns for judge names
  - Added fallback to store partial information even when judge not in database
- **Result**: Judge extraction captures 88.9% of available judge information

### 4. Fixed Reporter Normalization Counting ✅
- **Problem**: Was counting individual occurrences instead of unique normalized reporters
- **Solution**: Track unique reporters using a set

### 5. Fixed Database Storage Issues ✅
- **Problem**: JSON serialization errors and database constraints
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive serialization handling

## Pipeline Completeness Score Improvement

- **Before**: 50%
