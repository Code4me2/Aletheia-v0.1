# Current OCR Status - Court Processor Pipeline

## Executive Summary

The court processor currently has basic OCR capabilities integrated into the document ingestion pipeline. OCR is used as a fallback when PDF documents lack extractable text. While functional, the current implementation has significant limitations that affect data quality.

## Current Implementation

### Location and Components

1. **Primary OCR Module**: `pdf_processor.py`
   - Class: `PDFProcessor`
   - Main methods:
     - `process_pdf()`: Entry point for PDF processing
     - `extract_text_from_pdf()`: PyMuPDF text extraction
     - `ocr_pdf()`: Tesseract OCR fallback
     - `clean_text()`: Basic text cleaning

2. **Integration Point**: `services/document_ingestion_service.py`
   - Line 36: `self.pdf_processor = PDFProcessor(ocr_enabled=True)`
   - Line 396: `text, metadata = self.pdf_processor.process_pdf(tmp_path)`

3. **OCR Engine**: Tesseract 5.5.0
   - Invoked via subprocess (line 81-89 in `pdf_processor.py`)
   - Configuration: English language only, 30-second timeout per page

### Processing Flow

```
1. Document Retrieved from CourtListener
   ↓
2. Check for text fields (plain_text, html, xml_harvard)
   ↓
3. If no text → Download PDF
   ↓
4. Try PyMuPDF text extraction
   ↓
5. If no text → Tesseract OCR
   ↓
6. Basic text cleaning
   ↓
7. Store in database
```

### Current Capabilities

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses PyMuPDF (fitz) library
- **OCR Fallback**: Automatically triggered when no text found
- **Image Preprocessing**: 2x zoom for better OCR quality
- **Text Cleaning**: Fixes ligatures and removes excess whitespace
- **Page Limits**: Maximum 500 pages per document
- **Timeout Protection**: 30 seconds per page

## Identified Shortcomings

### 1. OCR Quality Issues (60% of documents affected)

Based on our analysis of 2,165 documents:

- **Concatenated Text**: `WILLIAMC.BRYSON` instead of `WILLIAM C. BRYSON`
- **Common Misspellings**: `GISTRATE` instead of `MAGISTRATE`
- **Garbled Characters**: `□□`, `ff '`, `»  Sh i`
- **Ligature Problems**: `ﬁ`, `ﬂ`, `ﬄ` not properly converted

### 2. Judge Extraction Rate: Only 40%

- OCR quality directly impacts judge name extraction
- Even with enhanced patterns, only improved to 60%
- Main cause: Poor spacing and character recognition

### 3. Technical Limitations

- **No Image Preprocessing**: No deskewing, denoising, or contrast enhancement
- **Single OCR Engine**: No validation or voting mechanism
- **Basic Configuration**: Default Tesseract settings, not optimized for legal documents
- **Limited Error Correction**: Only handles ligatures, no contextual fixes

### 4. Performance Constraints

- **Sequential Processing**: One page at a time
- **No GPU Acceleration**: CPU-only processing
- **Memory Usage**: Loads entire PDF into memory

## Impact on Pipeline Quality

### Completeness Score Impact
- Documents with OCR issues often score 60-70% completeness
- Missing judge information reduces score by 10-15%
- Garbled text affects citation extraction

### Quality Score Impact
- OCR errors directly reduce quality scores
- Average quality score for OCR'd documents: 65%
- Non-OCR documents average: 85%

## Current Statistics

From recent pipeline runs:
- **PDFs Downloaded**: ~30% of documents
- **OCR Performed**: ~10% of documents
- **OCR Success Rate**: ~90% (produces some text)
- **OCR Quality Rate**: ~40% (produces clean, accurate text)

## Configuration

Current Tesseract invocation (line 82 in `pdf_processor.py`):
```python
['tesseract', tmp_file.name, 'stdout', '-l', 'eng']
```

No custom configuration or preprocessing applied.

## Recommendations for Future Work

While new OCR development is on hold, when revisited, priority areas should be:

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Implement deskewing and contrast enhancement
2. **Configuration Optimization**: Use Tesseract PSM modes for legal documents
3. **Post-processing**: Implement legal-specific error correction
4. **Performance**: Consider batch processing and parallelization

## Conclusion

The current OCR implementation provides basic functionality but significantly impacts data quality. Approximately 60% of OCR-processed documents have quality issues that affect downstream processing, particularly judge extraction and citation parsing. The system works adequately for documents with clear, well-formatted text but struggles with scanned documents, older PDFs, and handwritten content.
