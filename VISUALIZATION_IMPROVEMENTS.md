# Hierarchical Visualization Improvements

## Summary
Enhanced the hierarchical document summarization visualization with smoother interface interactions and improved data communication patterns.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Smooth Animations & Transitions**
- Added cubic bezier easing to node focus transitions
- Implemented opacity fading for non-focused nodes
- Smooth level indicator animations with scale effects
- Enhanced navigation arrow transitions

### 2. **Keyboard Navigation**
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate between parent/child nodes and siblings
- **Home/End**: Quick jump to final summary or source documents
- **Ctrl+/**: Open search dialog
- Added visual keyboard shortcuts help panel

### 3. **Search Functionality**
- Full-text search across all node content
- Real-time search with debouncing
- Visual highlighting of search matches
- Click-to-navigate search results

### 4. **Minimap Overview**
- Interactive minimap showing full hierarchy structure
- Click-to-navigate functionality
- Viewport indicator showing current view position
- Collapsible design to save screen space

### 5. **Progressive Data Loading**
- Loading overlay for initial data fetch
- Real-time polling for processing updates
- Visual indicators for document processing status
- Automatic updates without full visualization redraw

### 6. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**
- Node processing states (processing, complete, error)
- Animated dashed borders for active processing
- Color-coded node states
- Smooth opacity transitions

### 7. **Improved User Experience**
- URL hash updates for bookmarkable nodes
- Tooltips on level indicators
- Responsive loading states
- Better error handling with fallback to mock data

## Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Enhancements
- Debounced search implementation
- Polling mechanism for real-time updates
- Minimap coordinate calculations
- Keyboard event handling with proper preventDefault

### CSS Improvements
- Smooth cubic-bezier transitions
- Animated processing indicators
- Responsive search dialog
- Loading overlay with semi-transparent background

### Data Communication
- Progressive loading with 2-second polling intervals
- Status-based rendering (processing/complete/error)
- Optimistic UI updates
- Graceful fallback to mock data

## Usage

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **←/→**: Navigate horizontally through hierarchy levels
- **↑/↓**: Navigate vertically between siblings
- **Home**: Jump to final summary
- **End**: Jump to source documents
- **Ctrl+/**: Open search

### Features
1. Click any node to focus on it
2. Use minimap to navigate large hierarchies
3. Search for specific content across all documents
4. Watch real-time updates as documents process

## Future Enhancements
- WebSocket support for true real-time updates
- Canvas/WebGL rendering for very large hierarchies
- Node clustering for better performance
- Export visualization as image/PDF
- Collaborative viewing with shared cursors
