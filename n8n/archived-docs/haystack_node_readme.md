# Haystack Elasticsearch n8n Node

A custom n8n node that integrates Haystack and Elasticsearch for advanced document search, hierarchical document management, and AI-powered legal document analysis workflows.

## üéØ High-Level Objectives

### Primary Goals

**Document Hierarchy Management**: Enable storage and retrieval of complex document relationships including source files, chunks, intermediate summaries, and final summaries in a tree-like structure that preserves provenance and lineage.

**Hybrid Search Capabilities**: Combine traditional keyword-based search (BM25) with semantic vector search to provide comprehensive document retrieval that handles both exact legal terminology and conceptual similarity.

**Legal Workflow Integration**: Support recursive document summarization workflows where large document collections are progressively condensed through AI agents while maintaining bidirectional traceability to source materials.

**n8n Ecosystem Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrate with n8n's workflow automation platform to enable complex document processing pipelines for legal research and case preparation.

### Core Use Cases

- **Judicial Access System**: Power the document analysis pipeline for legal professionals researching judge-specific ruling patterns and precedents
- **Recursive Summarization**: Support AI workflows that create hierarchical summaries while preserving links to original source documents
- **Legal Research**: Enable semantic search across legal documents with context-aware retrieval that understands document relationships
- **Document Provenance**: Maintain complete audit trails from final summaries back to original document sources

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### System Components

**Haystack Service Layer**: A FastAPI-based Python service that handles document processing, embedding generation, and search operations using the Haystack framework with BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 embeddings.

**Elasticsearch Backend**: Serves as the primary document store with support for both full-text search and dense vector storage, configured for 384-dimensional embeddings with HNSW indexing for performance.

**n8n Custom Node**: TypeScript-based node that provides a user-friendly interface for document operations within n8n workflows, handling data transformation and API communication.

**Document Hierarchy Schema**: Specialized data structure that tracks parent-child relationships, document types, hierarchy levels, and metadata to support complex document trees.

### Design Decisions

**REST API Pattern**: Uses HTTP-based communication between n8n (Node.js) and Haystack (Python) to maintain clean separation of concerns and enable independent scaling of components.

**Containerized Deployment**: Docker-based architecture ensures consistent environments across development and production while simplifying dependency management.

**Hybrid Search Strategy**: Combines BM25 (keyword matching) and vector similarity (semantic understanding) to maximize search effectiveness for legal terminology and concepts.

**Metadata-Rich Storage**: Extensive metadata tracking enables advanced filtering, hierarchy traversal, and workflow orchestration capabilities.
