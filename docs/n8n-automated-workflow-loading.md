# n8n Automated Workflow Loading

## Overview

This system automatically imports and activates n8n workflows on container startup, eliminating manual configuration. It uses a custom initialization script that runs before n8n's normal operation.

**‚úÖ The autoload mechanism is working perfectly** - workflows are successfully imported into n8n with deduplication to prevent duplicate entries. Custom node loading remains a separate issue.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ **Working Features**
- **Workflow Import**: All JSON files from `/workflow_json/` are successfully imported
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate imports by checking existing workflows
- **Health Checking**: Waits for n8n readiness before operations
- **Process Management**: Handles n8n lifecycle (background ‚Üí operations ‚Üí foreground)
- **Logging**: Clear progress tracking with import/skip counts
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing files or import failures

### ‚ùå **Known Limitations**
- **Custom Node Recognition**: n8n doesn't load custom nodes from mounted directory
- **Workflow Activation**: Workflows using custom nodes fail with "Unrecognized node type"
  - Affects: `n8n-nodes-hierarchicalSummarization`, `n8n-nodes-haystack`

### üéÜ **Recent Improvements**
- **Deduplication Added**: No more duplicate workflow imports
- **Single Script**: Cleaned up multiple experimental versions
- **Production Ready**: Stable implementation for workflow automation

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Init Script** (`/n8n/init-workflows.sh`)
   - Runs as Docker entrypoint
   - Manages n8n lifecycle during import
   - Uses wget for health checks (curl not available)
   - Implements deduplication to prevent duplicate imports

2. **Docker Configuration**
   ```yaml
   n8n:
     entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "/data/init-workflows.sh"]
     environment:
       - N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS=/home/node/.n8n/custom
     volumes:
       - ./workflow_json:/workflows:ro
       - ./n8n/init-workflows.sh:/data/init-workflows.sh:ro
       - ./n8n/custom-nodes:/home/node/.n8n/custom
   ```

3. **Workflow Storage** (`/workflow_json/`)
   - `main_workflow.json` - Main application workflow
   - `basic_search.json` - Haystack search workflow
   - `hierarchical-summarization-template.json` - Document processing

### Process Flow

```
1. Container Start ‚Üí Init Script Execution
2. Start n8n (background) ‚Üí Wait for Health (up to 60 seconds)
3. Check Existing Workflows ‚Üí Import New Workflows Only
4. Skip Duplicates ‚Üí Attempt Activation
5. Stop Background n8n ‚Üí Restart n8n (foreground)
```

### Implementation Details

#### Key Functions:

1. **`wait_for_n8n()`** - Health check using wget on `/healthz` endpoint
2. **`get_existing_workflows()`** - Lists current workflow names from n8n CLI
3. **`get_workflow_name_from_json()`** - Extracts name using jq or grep/sed fallback
4. **`import_workflows()`** - Imports with deduplication logic
5. **`activate_workflows()`** - Attempts to activate all workflows

#### Example Output:
```

[n8n-init] Starting n8n in background...
[n8n-init] Waiting for n8n to be ready...
[n8n-init] n8n is ready!

## Implementation Details

### Workflow Requirements

```json
{
  "name": "Workflow Name",     // Required
  "active": false,              // Required
  "nodes": [...],               // Required
  "connections": {...}          // Required
}
```

### Node Naming Conventions

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Standard | `n8n-nodes-base.nodeName` | `n8n-nodes-base.webhook` |
| LangChain | `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.nodeName` | `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent` |
| Custom | `n8n-nodes-package.nodeName` | `n8n-nodes-haystack.haystackSearch` |

### Files Being Imported

All files in `/workflow_json/`:
- ‚úÖ Successfully imported (appears in n8n UI)
- ‚úÖ Proper JSON structure recognized
- ‚ùå Cannot activate if using custom nodes

## Custom Node Loading Issue

### Current Situation

**The workflow import is successful** - the issue is that n8n cannot find the custom node types referenced in the workflows. Despite having:
- Custom nodes mounted at `/home/node/.n8n/custom`
- Environment variable `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS=/home/node/.n8n/custom`
- Proper `package.json` with `n8n` field
- Built `dist/` directories with compiled JavaScript

n8n still reports "Unrecognized node type" for custom nodes.

```json
{
  "n8n": {
    "n8nNodesApiVersion": 1,
    "nodes": ["dist/nodes/NodeName/NodeName.node.js"]
  }
}
```

### Affected Nodes

| Node | Purpose | Error |
|------|---------|-------|
| `n8n-nodes-haystack` | Document search | Unrecognized node type |
| `n8n-nodes-hierarchicalSummarization` | Document processing | Unrecognized node type |
| `n8n-nodes-deepseek` | AI integration | Not used in workflows |
| `n8n-nodes-yake` | Keyword extraction | Not used in workflows |
| `n8n-nodes-citationchecker` | Citation validation | Not used in workflows |
| `n8n-nodes-bitnet` | BitNet AI | Not used in workflows |

### Investigation Results

1. **Package Name Mismatch** (‚úÖ FIXED): 
   - `n8n-nodes-haystack-rag` ‚Üí `n8n-nodes-haystack` (fixed)
   - `n8n-nodes-hierarchicalsummarization` ‚Üí `n8n-nodes-hierarchicalSummarization` (fixed)

2. **Permission Issues**: 
   - Mounted volumes have different ownership than container user
   - NPM install attempts fail with EACCES errors

3. **Loading Mechanism**:
   - n8n should auto-load from `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS` directory
   - Despite fixing package names, nodes are still not recognized
   - This appears to be an issue with n8n v1.101.1 not loading custom extensions properly

## Solutions

### Implemented Solution: Fixed Package Names ‚úÖ

The root cause was package name mismatches between the custom nodes' package.json files and what the workflows expected. This has been fixed:

1. **Haystack Node**: Changed `"name": "n8n-nodes-haystack-rag"` to `"name": "n8n-nodes-haystack"`
2. **Hierarchical Summarization**: Changed `"name": "n8n-nodes-hierarchicalsummarization"` to `"name": "n8n-nodes-hierarchicalSummarization"`
3. **Rebuilt nodes** to ensure dist folders are updated

### Alternative Solutions (Since custom extension loading is not working)

#### Option 1: Custom Docker Image (RECOMMENDED)

Create a custom n8n image with nodes pre-installed. This is the most reliable approach:
```dockerfile
# Build custom n8n image with nodes pre-installed
FROM n8nio/n8n:latest
COPY ./custom-nodes /custom-nodes
RUN cd /custom-nodes && npm install each-node
```

#### Option 2: Install Nodes at Container Start

Modify the init script to copy and install nodes directly into n8n's node_modules:

```bash
# Copy custom nodes to n8n's node_modules directory
cp -r /home/node/.n8n/custom/* /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n/node_modules/
```

#### Option 3: Use n8n Community Nodes

Publish the custom nodes to npm and install them as community nodes through n8n's UI.

#### Option 4: Downgrade n8n Version

Use an older n8n version where custom extension loading worked properly.

**Note**: 
- NPM install in running container fails due to permission issues with mounted volumes
- N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS environment variable is not loading custom nodes in n8n v1.101.1
- Package name fixes were implemented but n8n still doesn't recognize the custom nodes

## Usage Guide

### Initial Setup

```bash
# 1. Ensure custom nodes are built (one-time setup)
cd /home/manesha/AI_Legal/Aletheia-v0.1/n8n
./build-custom-nodes.sh

# 2. Start n8n with auto-import
docker compose up -d n8n

# 3. Watch import progress
docker compose logs -f n8n | grep "n8n-init"
```

### Adding New Workflows

1. Add JSON file to `./workflow_json/`
2. Ensure required fields are present
3. Restart container: `docker compose restart n8n`

### Monitoring

```bash
# List imported workflows
docker compose exec n8n n8n list:workflow

# Check activation status
docker compose logs n8n | grep "Activation"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| "exec: no such file" | Script mount issue | Verify mount path `/data/init-workflows.sh` | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| "NOT NULL constraint" | Missing workflow fields | Add `name` and `active` fields | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| "Unrecognized node type" | Custom nodes not loaded | See custom node solutions below | ‚ùå Ongoing |
| "Read-only file system" | Correct behavior | Script is read-only mounted | ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info |
| Duplicate workflows | Pre-deduplication imports | Use cleanup commands below | ‚úÖ Prevented |

### Quick Fixes

```bash
# Check for duplicate workflows
docker compose exec n8n n8n list:workflow | cut -d'|' -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Remove duplicate workflows (keep one, delete others)
docker compose exec n8n n8n delete:workflow --id=WORKFLOW_ID

# Manually activate workflow
docker compose exec n8n n8n update:workflow --id=WORKFLOW_ID --active=true

# Clear all data and start fresh (nuclear option)
docker compose down n8n
docker volume rm aletheia-v01_n8n_data
docker compose up -d n8n

# Verify deduplication is working
docker compose logs n8n | grep "Import complete"
```
