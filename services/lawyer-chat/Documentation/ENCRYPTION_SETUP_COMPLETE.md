# Field-Level Encryption Setup Complete âœ…

## What Was Done

### 1. Environment Configuration
- **Added to `.env`**: `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY=321accf3fe5e2653fa4383e8bd1118cef8c48d087233da42d52c432b1054eb03`
- **Location**: Added after NextAuth configuration section
- **Security**: Generated using `openssl rand -hex 32` for cryptographic strength

### 2. Docker Configuration Updated
- **Modified `docker-compose.yml`**: Added `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY=${FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY}` to lawyer-chat environment variables
- **Line 96**: Ensures the encryption key is passed to the container

### 3. Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:
- `/src/lib/crypto.ts` - Encryption/decryption utilities
- `/src/lib/prisma-encryption.ts` - Prisma middleware
- `/scripts/test-encryption.ts` - Local encryption test
- `/scripts/test-nextauth-compatibility.ts` - NextAuth compatibility test
- `/scripts/test-api-endpoints.ts` - API endpoint test
- `/scripts/re-encrypt-sensitive-fields.ts` - Migration script
- `/scripts/test-docker-encryption.sh` - Docker integration test

#### Modified Files:
- `/src/lib/prisma.ts` - Added encryption middleware
- `/.env` - Added FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY
- `/docker-compose.yml` - Added env variable to container
- `/package.json` - Added test scripts

## Next Steps

### 1. Rebuild Docker Image
```bash
docker compose build lawyer-chat
```

### 2. Restart Services
```bash
docker compose down lawyer-chat
docker compose up -d lawyer-chat
```

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
# Test encryption in Docker
./services/lawyer-chat/scripts/test-docker-encryption.sh

# Or test individual components:
docker compose exec lawyer-chat npm run test-encryption
docker compose exec lawyer-chat npm run test-nextauth
docker compose exec lawyer-chat npm run test-api
```

### 4. Migrate Existing Data (if any)
```bash
docker compose exec lawyer-chat npm run migrate-encryption
```

## What Will Happen

Once the Docker image is rebuilt and running:

1. **Automatic Encryption**: All sensitive fields will be automatically encrypted when saved:
   - User: registration tokens, password reset tokens, IP addresses
   - Session: session tokens
   - Account: OAuth tokens
   - VerificationToken: verification tokens
   - AuditLog: IP addresses

2. **Automatic Decryption**: All encrypted fields will be automatically decrypted when read

3. **Transparent Operation**: No application code changes needed - everything works as before

4. **Database Storage**: Encrypted values will be stored with prefix `enc:v1:` followed by base64 data

## Verification

After rebuilding, you can verify encryption is working by:

1. Creating a new user registration
2. Checking the database directly:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec db psql -U aletheia_user -d lawyerchat -c "SELECT registrationIp FROM \"User\" LIMIT 1;"
   ```
   You should see values starting with `enc:v1:`

3. Running the test script: `./scripts/test-docker-encryption.sh`

## Important Notes

1. **Backup the encryption key**: The key in `.env` is critical - losing it means losing access to encrypted data
2. **Don't commit `.env`**: It's already in `.gitignore`
3. **Different keys for environments**: Use different encryption keys for dev/staging/production
4. **Key rotation**: Plan for key rotation in the future

## Troubleshooting

If encryption doesn't work after rebuild:

1. Check environment variable is set:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec lawyer-chat env | grep FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY
   ```

2. Check logs for errors:
   ```bash
   docker compose logs lawyer-chat | grep -i encrypt
   ```

3. Ensure Prisma client was regenerated during build

The setup is complete and ready for Docker rebuild!
