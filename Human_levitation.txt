Abstract 
Human levitation occurs when the physical body rises into the air and then hovers 
or moves around, seemingly in defiance of the force of gravity. Traditionally most 
levitation reports have originated from seven groups: shamanism, people 
supposedly possessed by demonic spiritual entities, those subjected to poltergeist 
activity, Spiritualism, people who believe they have been abducted by aliens, martial 
arts such as qigong and mysticism. These anecdotal reports generally describe 
levitation as rare, spontaneous and involuntary, although some people seem able to 
levitate at will. So far almost no scientific research appears to have been 
conducted into this phenomenon. In order to persuade empirical sciences such as 
parapsychology that human levitation warrants further investigation, this qualitative 
study contains two components. Firstly, there is a thematic comparison of historical 
and modern levitation reports from the seven groups to see what physical, cultural 
and phenomenological circumstances they may have in common. Three kinds of 
evidence have been examined in this comparison: general features of the groups 
that produce levitation reports; interviews about paranormal phenomena such as 
levitation with a sample of Christian priests and pastors, Spiritualists and qigong 
instructors; and six people who claim to have levitated have also been interviewed. 
Secondly, to assist future researchers in their investigations, the thesis includes a 
hypothesis generating exercise which seeks clues from the thematic comparison 
and interviews as to how human levitation might work. The conclusions reached in 
the thematic comparison are that most members of the seven groups believe in one 
or more spiritual realms that contain entities and/or energies that can facilitate 
paranormal phenomena such as human levitation. Members of some groups (eg: 
shamans, Spiritualists, qigong practitioners and mystics) may deliberately seek to 
interact with or access these entities or powers, while others (eg: poltergeist activity 
and spirit possession) may encounter them involuntarily. It also appears that, 
regardless of which group they belong to, all those who levitate, whether 
deliberately or involuntarily, do so while in an altered state of consciousness (ASC). 
The hypothesis-generating exercise, therefore, postulates that certain ASCs 
facilitate human levitation, and that further research into the capacity of 
consciousness to access what appears to be transcendent or transpersonal powers 
is recommended.

Introduction 
1.1 
Background 
Princess Pema Choki, the daughter of a Himalayan maharajah, claims that as a 
young girl she would regularly visit her uncle, a famous thaumaturge: 
He was the most extraordinary man I have ever met. ... He did what you 
would call exercises in levitation. I used to take him in a little rice. He 
would be motionless in mid-air. Every day he rose a little higher. In the 
end he rose so high that I found it difficult to hand the rice up to him. I 
was a little girl, and had to stand on tip-toe. (in Maraini, 1951/2000, 
> 5 2 ) ' 
Reports of human levitation such as this have evoked awe, bewilderment, or 
disbelief throughout history but for most of that time the phenomenon has been 
regarded as having no significant practical or social purpose. Today, modern 
technology is increasingly producing devices that lift off the ground or fly, such as 
magnetic levitation trains, hang-gliders, jet planes, rockets, satellites and space 
craft. If human levitation is ever proved to exist, and if it involves an energy that 
can nullify or overcome gravity, it may have significant scientific implications, but it 
has never been seriously researched by any academic discipline. 
Olivier Leroy (1928) claims that, according to ancient traditions, "The human body is 
able... to be raised from the ground, to remain suspended in mid-air without any 
visible prop, and sometimes move about in it, without any traceable action of any 
physical force" (p.v). The Oxford English Dictionary {Simpson & Weiner, 1989) 
defines levitation as "The action or process of rising, or raising (a body), from the 
ground by 'spiritualistic' means" (p.870). The verb 'levitate' was first used in this 
sense in England in 1875 (p.870). Prior to that there was apparently no specific 
term to describe the phenomenon. The New Catholic Encyclopaedia (Aumann, 
2003) defines levitation as "the suspension of a material body in the air without any 
visible support, in apparent opposition to the law of gravity" (p.522). The 
encyclopaedia also claims that the three possible causes of levitation are God, the 
devil, or an unknown natural force. Guiley (1991), on the other hand, defines 
levitation as "a phenomenon of psychokinesis (PK) in which objects, people, 
animals... lift up into the air without, known physical means and float or fly about" 
(p.327). These definitions illustrate that, although there is general agreement 
about its physical characteristics, whatever causes levitation js still the subject of

speculation. This research project concentrates on human levitation; it does not 
discuss non-human levitation. While acknowledging that there are various spiritual 
and religious explanations for human levitation, I adopt the perspective that it is 
probably the same mechanism or energy that levitates everyone. Most 
parapsychologists refer to human levitation as a psychokinetic (PK) phenomenon. 
This term originally meant movement by the mind or mind-over-matter but today it is 
used by researchers as a convenient, neutral word to describe a variety of 
paranormal phenomena without the assumption that they exist or how they might 
work. The word psychokinesis (PK) will be used in this sense throughout this thesis. 
Examples of what may be partial human levitation or possible precursors to 
levitation are also occasionally reported. For example, there are claims that some 
martial arts practitioners can become unusually light or almost immovably attached 
to the ground. Bonewits (1974) suggests that levitation "might have some 
connection with the traditional skills of Eastern adepts in making objects heavier or 
lighter, something we could call Mass Control" (p.43). Walking on water might be 
an example of mass control. Becoming immoveable or much heavier than normal, 
referred to as "excessive gravitation" (Melton, 2001, p.909), is also reported to 
occur involuntarily to visionaries or religious ecstatics (Cornwell, 1991, p.143) and 
in some instances of spirit possession (Guiley, 1989, p.119). Becoming heavier or 
leaping higher or for longer than normal is harder to distinguish from average 
behaviour than fuil levitation, which suggests that the force involved is capable of 
integrating smoothly with routine human movement. Although they do not fall 
within the definition of levitation, examples of mass control and excessive 
gravitation will be discussed during this research because they may provide clues 
about the nature of human levitation. 
Most encyclopaedias of the paranormal mention levitation, but so far I have only 
been able to locate three books on the subject (Charles & Jordan, 1995; Leroy, 
1928; Richards, 1980) and of these only Leroy's is scholarly, although it suffers 
from significant religious bias. Apart from the controversial nature of the subject, 
one reason for this neglect may be that it is unclear which academic discipline 
should study human levitation. Parapsychology might seem the most appropriate, 
but I have been unable to find a parapsychologist anywhere in the world who is 
currently researching this subject. The headline of a January 2002 New Scientist 
magazine cover story reads, "Anti-gravity: Can the heretics turn physics upside

down?" (Cohen, 2002, p.25). The article claims that NASA intends to spend 
US$600,000 on investigating whether it is possible to create a device to shield 
physical matter from the force of gravity. Apart from turning physics upside down, 
such an anti-gravity discovery could have enormous implications for the future of 
transportation and space exploration, yet NASA does not seem to be interested in 
spending any money investigating human levitation which might also involve a force 
that could shield or counteract gravity. 
1.2 
Purpose of the Study 
Human levitation appears to have been almost completely ignored by the academic 
community. The purpose of this qualitative study is to persuade empirical 
researchers (eg: parapsychologists) that the phenomenon of human levitation is 
sufficiently credible to warrant further investigation, and to provide them with 
enough information to commence their research. This will be done by mirroring 
parapsychology's three basic concerns, which Dr Harvey Irwin (2004, p.7) claims 
are authenticity, underlying process and phenomenology. By 'authenticity' he 
means whether the phenomenon being investigated is "ontologically real" (p.7). In 
his opinion, because parapsychology is a scientific discipline, the authenticity issue 
"properly can only be resolved in the scientific laboratory" (p.7), although he 
believes that it is appropriate to investigate how a so-called paranormal 
phenomenon might work even if its authenticity has not yet been proven (p.8). 
However, it is unlikely that anyone would receive funding or be motivated to 
research human levitation within a laboratory unless preliminary research 
elsewhere had demonstrated that it is reasonable to believe that the phenomenon 
exists, and has made suggestions as to how the laboratory research might proceed. 
This research project will not attempt to prove that any individual levitation report is 
genuine. It will only address the authenticity question to the degree required to 
persuade empirical researchers that the phenomenon is sufficiently convincing to 
warrant further investigation. Instead of ignoring the slowly increasing body of 
human levitation reports, as the empirical sciences are doing, this project will study 
them primarily to seek information that relates to Irwin's underlying process and 
phenomenology components. 
So, although this is not a parapsychology investigation of human levitation by 
mirroring that discipline's basic concerns, it will hopefully persuade other 
researchers to take the subject more seriously. By providing details about the 


--- Page 13 ---

groups that traditionally produce levitation reports it may assist them in finding 
someone who can levitate, and provide them with some helpful research 
hypotheses. In summary, the two main components of this research project are: 
1) A thematic comparison of historical and modern human levitation reports, 
and of the groups that have traditionally produced them, to see what 
physical, cultural and phenomenological circumstances the levitators and 
their groups may have in common. 
2) A hypothesis-generating exercise that seeks clues that might begin to explain 
what causes human levitation. This information may assist future 
researchers to investigate the dynamics of levitation from a more empirical 
perspective. 
1.3 
Research Perspective 
I am undertaking this study because I believe that some human levitation reports 
are true and would like to investigate the matter further. Admittedly, some 
levitation reports may be the result of hagiographic exaggeration, delusions, 
confusion, or dishonesty, but, on the other hand, one suitably documented example 
of levitation would authenticate the phenomenon. Unlike many sceptics I do rot 
adopt the attitude that most paranormal reports are fictitious because sc'env 
cannot at present explain them. Heath (2003) writes that "it is inappropriate ^o 
ignore reports of levitation simply because we do not want to have to consider how 
they fit into our current model of the world" (p.17). It is myopic, illogical and 
unscientific to claim that something is impossible if it has not been seriously 
investigated and, as Brian Inglis (1979, p.519) points out, scientists have always 
been aware that the study of anomalies can lead to significant discoveries. I 
believe that research into psi1 is important because, if these events really do occur, 
they reveal that current scientific explanations about the nature of reality are 
incomplete. But, as parapsychologist Richard Broughton (1991) notes, "From the 
discovery of anomalies — pieces that do not fit into the prevailing scientific picture 
— to the general acceptance of a revised picture that makes sense of the 
anomalies, is often a long and difficult road" (p.77). The physicist Dr Claude 
Swanson explains that 
1 See Section 1.6 (Terminology) for a definition of psi.

appropriate instruments to measure paranormal phenomena will 
probably evolve as our understanding of the phenomena evolves.... 
Until we reach that stage, it is important that we include a liberal 
sprinkling of anecdotes and accounts by credible individuals of their 
anomalous experiences. These experiences are like Franklin and his 
kite. They demonstrate that a phenomenon is there, and that it has 
certain general characteristics. It is the first step in developing a 
scientific understanding. (Swanson, 2003, p.7) 
There are some religious devotees who claim that miracles can never be explained 
scientifically and that it is inappropriate and dangerous to investigate demonic 
forces, but in my opinion, both claims are probably untrue and should not be 
allowed to hamper scientific investigation. I believe that the claim that reports of 
human levitation are untrue because they defy common sense and contradict the 
laws of physics is unreasonable because common sense is historically and 
culturally dependent, and science clearly does not know everything there is to learn 
about physics or human consciousness. I support Heath's (2003) assertion that 
"the argument that levitation can't exist because gravity says so is completely 
specious" (p.18). I regard reported scientific anomalies like levitation as invitations 
to research the apparent gaps in our understanding of reality. The parapsychologist 
Dr Dean Radin explains that 
when the evidence for an anomaly becomes overwhelming, and the 
anomaly cannot be easily accommodated by the existing scientific 
worldview, this is a very important sign that either our assumptions 
about reality are wrong or our assumptions about how we come to 
understand things are wrong. (Radin, 1997, p.250) 
Linking science and common sense, the physicist Michio Kaku writes: 
If all our common-sense notions about the universe were correct, then 
science would have solved the secrets of the universe thousands of 
years ago. The purpose of science is to peel back the layers of the 
appearance of objects to reveal their underlying nature. In fact, if 
appearance and essence were the same thing, there would be no need 
for science. (Kaku, 1994, p.vii) 
Psychologist Hans Eysenck and parapsychologist Carl Sargent (1993) explain that 
"parapsychology is a science whose findings have implications for everyone. Those 
implications are practical... and may one day profoundly change the way in which 
we think of ourselves and our lives" (p.186). While discussing the future of science 
and psi they noted that 
science often handles true innovation very badly.... At heart, science is 
all too often a deeply conservative process. The suggestion that 
scientists are simply being cautious, wisely reluctant to accept new

evidence prematurely, fails to explain the irrational emotion displayed 
by many scientists when faced with evidence of genuine anomalies. 
(Eysenck & Sargent, 1993, p.175) 
Similarly, Broughton claims that 
the prevailing scientific view will not give in easily to a challenger, and 
the battle is waged not only with data and reasoned debate but also 
with ridicule and scorn, censorship and denial, and just about every 
other rhetorical and political tactic. (Broughton, 1991, p.77) 
Speaking about "the metaphysics of science, that branch of philosophy concerned 
with the nature of reality," Radin (1997, p.249) points out that 
most of the fundamental assumptions underlying classical science 
have been severely challenged in recent years. As the old assumptions 
dissolve because of advancements in many disciplines, new 
assumptions are carrying us towards a concept'on of the world that is 
entirely compatible with psi. Few scientists have paid close attention to 
this dramatic shift in scientific fundamentals, and the general public 
has heard almost nothing about it. (Radin, 1997, p.249) 
Many paranormal experiences, such as telepathy or out-of-body experiences, 
cannot be witnessed by others, whereas levitation, if it occurs, would be clearly 
visible and unambiguous even though many explanations for it involve invisible 
spiritual forces. To emphasise this point, Willis Harman (1980) writes that psi 
research 
lies midway between and links the objective world of public 
observation, the domain of 'ordinary' science, and the 'private' world of 
subjective experience. The phenomena of psychic research are 
anomalous — their occurrence is widely attested to, yet they do not 'fit 
in'. Still they speak clearly to the point that something is fundamentally 
incomplete about a world view which cannot accommodate them. They 
also serve as a sort of reality test for the universe of inner experience. 
They are not wholly inner—they are characterised by something being 
publicly observable. Neither are they wholly outer, since some activity 
of the mind is clearly involved. (Harman, 1980, p.240) 
Radin makes a similar observation when he writes that parapsychology straddles 
the edge separating the mind-oriented disciplines such as clinical and 
transpersonal psychology and the matter-oriented disciplines such as 
neuroscience and cognitive sciences. Parapsychology explicitly studies 
the interactions between consciousness and the physical world.... and 
it assumes that scientific methods can be used to study this realm in a 
rigorous way. (Radin, 1997, p.263) 
Levitation is often regarded as the product of inner spiritual experiences, which 
illustrates Harman's point, yet researchers studying religions often ignore psi or 
miraculous phenomena/ Religious historian Jess Hollenback (1996) writes that 


--- Page 16 ---

7 
most major studies of mysticism "do not pay sufficient attention to the supernormal 
or 'miraculous' phenomena that so frequently accompany mystical states of 
consciousness" (p.17). Hollenback questions the link between mystical states of 
consciousness and psi events: 
Is it possible that the closer study of these supernormal 
accompaniments of mystical experience might bring forth data that 
challenges the validity of psychologism, the view that everything in a 
mystical state of consciousness originates from within the mystic's own 
mind? (Hollenback, 1996, p.20) 
Following Hollenback's observations, and given that there exist numerous reports of 
levitating mystics from most major religions, my personal belief is that human 
levitation is a genuine and neglected, rather than illusory, phenomenon that 
warrants serious investigation. 
1.4 
Methodology 
Human levitation has often been regarded as a religious or miraculous 
phenomenon, but a wider examination reveals that the main groups that have 
traditionally produced levitation reports are: 
1. shamans 
2. people supposedly possessed by demonic spiritual entities 
3. those subjected to poltergeist activity 
4. spirit mediums (Spiritualism) 
5. people who believe that they have been abducted by aliens (abductees) 
6. practitioners of Eastern martial arts traditions such as qigong (sometimes 
spelt qi gong, qi kung or ch'i kung) 
7. mystics from all major religions 
A research project's methodology depends on what is being investigated and why. I 
do not consider it relevant, nor is it feasible, for this study to document the history, 
beliefs and current dynamics of the groups that have produced levitation reports. 
Instead, this project follows the thread of human levitation that appears in each of 
them. The empirical study of human levitation clearly falls within the domain of 
parapsychological research. As we have seen, Irwin (2004) contends that 
parapsychology research concentrates on three central issues, "authenticity, 
underlying processes, and phenomenology" (p.7). Although he does not specifically 
discuss the subject, Irwin's three issues can be adopted for the study of human 
levitation, asking about its authenticity, how it works and what the experience of 


--- Page 17 ---

8 
levitation is like. The main thrust of this research will focus on Irwin's second 
parapsychological issue, which he describes as "process-oriented research ... 
designed to ascertain the processes by which parapsychological experiences are 
enacted" (p.8). Irwin (2004) further claims that, "like other behavioural scientists 
parapsychologists seek to understand the bases of human experience" (p.8). This 
leads to his thiro issue, phenomenology, which "focuses on the description of 
parapsychological phenomena from the experient's point of view; that is, 
investigators seek to establish the characteristics of the phenomena as actually 
experienced and the impact such experiences have upon the individual" (p.8). Irwin 
asserts that "phenomenological research should set the research agenda in 
parapsychology, because it has the function of specifying the essential 
characteristics of the phenomenon to be explained" (p.9). His justification for this 
claim is that 
although it certainly is possible to study phenomenological 
characteristics of the experiences without the slightest concern for 
underlying processes, such study often does suggest ideas about the 
nature of underlying processes. In other words, phenomenological 
research is useful in generating hypotheses for investigation in process-
oriented research. (Irwin, 2004, p.8) 
Historically there have been several examples of researchers regarding the 
collecting of anecdotal paranormal experiences as a suitable basis for further 
research. For example, parapsychologist Dr Pamela Heath (2003) adopts a 
phenomenological approach by interviewing eight people who claim to have 
experienced PK, in order to learn more about the phenomenon. Irwin (2004) 
reports that early Society for Psychical Research investigators not only regarded 
spontaneous case collections "as a means of ascertaining the authenticity of 
parapsychological phenomena" (p.31), but 
through content analysis of cases researchers hoped to define, for 
example, the circumstances under which each different type of 
parapsychological experience occurred and thereby to gain some 
insight into the ways in which the supposed paranormal processes 
could operate. (Irwin, 2004, p.31) 
Similarly, in the 1950s the American parapsychologist Louisa Rhine collected a 
large number of uninvestigated extrasensory perception (ESP) reports because she 
believed that any trends revealed by content analysis "could indicate the nature of 
the processes underlying parapsychological experiences" (in Irwin, 2004, p.31). A 
similar interest in anecdotal psi reports is displayed by parapsychology researchers

Dr Edward Kelly and Dr Ralph Locke (1981) while discussing the suggested link 
between altered states of consciousness and psi. They write that 
the literatures that we will draw upon are extremely heterogeneous in 
scientific value, each presenting special preoccupations, peculiarities 
and problems to the modern investigator. Nonetheless, we believe that 
collectively they represent an enormous treasure house of reported 
human experiences related to the characteristics and conditions of 
occurrence of apparent psi events. (Kelly & Locke, 1981, p.5) 
As these researchers acknowledge, the large number of anecdotal reports of 
anomalous or psi events from throughout history comprise the raw data that 
parapsychologists need to trawl through to create hypotheses and research 
methodologies for their laboratory work. The clarity and reliability of these reports 
are obviously problematic, but, without their existence, parapsychology as a science 
would probably not even exist. In this vein, Kelly and Locke describe their survey as 
primarily a hypothesis-generating exercise, an effort of discovery rather 
than one of proof. For this purpose, we propose — and request the 
reader — to adopt an attitude of "willing suspension of disbelief" 
towards various claims that psi has occurred and to emphasise instead 
the circumstances under which it is believed to have occurred. (Kelly & 
Locke, 1981, p.6) 
A preliminary reading of both historical and current levitation reports reveals that 
the majority describe spontaneous rather than deliberate or recurrent events. The 
typical levitator was not expecting it to occur and may have no coherent explanation 
as to why it happened at that particular place and time. The levitator may have 
carried out the same activity that preceded the levitation, such as a meditation or 
seance, on several other occasions without experiencing levitation. While 
discussing spontaneous psi events, Joseph H. Rush (1986) writes that 
obviously an investigator's chance of being present when a non-
recurrent psi incident occurs is nearly zero. The first approach to the 
investigation of a rare phenomenon is to collect reports by persons who 
have witnessed or experienced such a phenomenon and try to interpret 
them. Practically all investigations of non-recurrent spontaneous psi 
events... have been done by means of such case collections. (Rush, 
1986, p.48) 
Rush continues by pointing out that 
the advantages of spontaneous case reports as material for psi 
research are limited but important. They reflect the involvement of psi 
in everyday life, in a great variety of situations and subjective modes. 
To the extent that they are valid accounts, they provide the investigator 
[with] a sampling of the natural range of psi phenomena without the 


--- Page 19 ---

restrictions on their variety or their physical and psychosocial contexts 
that experimental procedures necessarily impose. (Rush, 1986, p.48) 
Rush, however, does acknowledge that "The evidential status of spontaneous psi 
experiences is ambivalent" (p.50), although he adds that the reports may be 
sufficiently convincing to persuade researchers to conduct further investigations 
into such matters. Heath (2003), too, asserts that "non-experimental research is 
valuable in documenting the richness and variety of spontaneous psi. as well as 
giving us a general sense of what factors and themes are associated with PK" 
(p.107). Although he acknowledges the importance of laboratory research into psi 
phenomena, Dr Raynor Johnson (1953/1971) asserts that 
the continuous accumulation of records of spontaneous phenomena is, 
however, still of great importance. There are some fields of psychical 
research into which the experimental method has not yet penetrated: 
apparitions, hauntings, poltergeist phenomena, levitations, etc. Here 
the only available method of progress at present is through the 
collection of well-attested data with as much detail of conditions as 
possible. (Johnson, 1953/1971, p. 130) 
While reviewing the possible relationship between psi phenomena and the future 
evolution of the human race, Michael Murphy (1992) suggests that one reason why 
"no scientific studies have recorded instances of levitation" (p.536) is that 
levitation may only occur during rare and spontaneous ecstasies that 
cannot be programmed to meet the requirements of a scientific 
experiment. Superordinary lifting from the ground, if it in fact occurs, 
would require an improbable set of circumstances, which a scientist 
would be lucky to witness. Levitation, like other holy powers, would 
have to be caught "in the wild". (Murphy, 1992, p.536) 
During my study I have not come in contact with anyone who is able to levitate at 
will. Murphy seems to support the suggestion that an appropriate technique for 
investigating human levitation is to concentrate on gathering information from 
whatever sources are available 'in the wild' rather than within a laboratory. 
Writing about his research into reports of alien abductions, or 'encounters' as he 
prefers to term them, Harvard professor of psychiatry, Dr John Mack (2000a), 
discusses the methodological problems with studying such reports. While claiming 
that "all knowledge of reality starts with experience" (p.22), Mack writes that, 
"Perhaps it is characteristic of certain anomalies that they refuse to locate 
themselves in any of our established disciplines, thus forcing us to use a 
multidisciplinary approach or requiring the creation of a new discipline altogether" 
(p.23). Mack adopts a largely phenomenological approach in his research. Apart 


--- Page 20 ---

11 
from checking that they are not suffering from any known mental illnesses, he does 
not attempt to verify his interviewees' alien encounter reports because it would be 
almost impossible to do so. Mack's methodology involves providing detailed alien 
encounter case studies combined with a thematic comparison of reports from 
several other interviewees. As he writes: 
What appears to yield the best results, as measured by a steady 
emergence of information or knowledge, falling short of conventional 
demands for proof, is a combination of meticulous empirical 
observation together with carefully recorded narratives of first hand 
experiences, matching, sorting, and comparing accounts from many 
individuals from different locations and cultures. (Mack, 2000a, p.10) 
While analysing the debate about laboratory versus field-based methodologies in 
parapsychology research, philosopher Professor Stephen Braude (1986) points out 
that he "cannot support the prevailing view that the non-experimental evidence of 
parapsychology is either inherently weak or at least inferior to the laboratory 
evidence" (p.3). He claims that such evidence "has been unjustly maligned" and 
could instead be seen as "an extremely valuable source of information concerning 
the nature and limits, and even the reality, of psi functioning" (1986, p.3). Braude 
(1986) concludes that "non-experimental evidence may be our single best source of 
information about psi, at least in its most customary form" (p.10), and that 
"parapsychology would be in a sorry state indeed if the experimental evidence were 
the only evidence available" (p.ll). 
Although these opinions about research methodologies derive from a range of 
disciplines, the central point is that a thematic comparison of anecdotal levitation 
reports and of the seven groups that traditionally produce them, combined with a 
hypothesis generating exercise about how the phenomenon might work (including 
practical recommendations for further research), appears to be the most 
appropriate qualitative methodology with which to conduct an investigation into the 
rare and largely spontaneous psi phenomenon of human levitation. In her study of 
near-death experience reports, Carol Zaleski (1987) takes a similar approach, 
writing that "Comparative study will highlight features that are not otherwise 
obvious, putting into sharper relief the elements that are culturally specific and at 
the same time drawing attention to perennial aspects" (p.6). By mirroring two of the 
basic concerns of parapsychology (underlying process and phenomenology) this 
approach is designed to help persuade more empirical researchers that the 


--- Page 21 ---

12 
available data about human levitation is sufficiently interesting to warrant further 
scientific investigation. 
1.5 
Information sources 
This study combines information from several overlapping sources: 
1) I have reviewed numerous levitation reports from the literature of shamanism, 
mysticism, Spiritualism, spirit possession, poltergeist, activity, ufology (UFOs and 
alien abductions), martial arts traditions such as qigong and some miscellaneous 
groups. What I have looked for are physical and personal descriptions of levitation 
events as well as descriptions of the cultural settings in which they occurred. 
2) I have interviewed six people who claim to have levitated, and received e-mail 
and phone reports from two others who claim to have levitated, and two who said 
they almost levitated while participating in the lifting game or Transcendental 
Meditation. All of these people fit into one or more of the seven groups that 
traditionally produce levitation reports. 
3) I have interviewed a sample of Spiritualists, Christian priests and pastors 
(Catholics and Anglicans) and qigong instructors1 to ascertain their opinions about 
miraculous or psi events such as human levitation. Although very few of them claim 
to have levitated or to have seen someone else do it, their beliefs are important 
because they represent the particular spiritual and cultural environment 
surrounding levitators or potential levitators within these groups. 
It has not been possible to conduct interviews with representatives of all the groups 
that have traditionally produced levitation reports. Instead of interviewing samples 
of indigenous shamans and mystics from around the world, I have used levitation 
reports from anthropological, religious and paranormal literature. For ethical and 
availability reasons, I have been unable to interview people who are or have been 
spiritually possessed or have suffered from poltergeist activity. These people are 
rare indeed and may not be able to provide informed consent to be interviewed. 
I have referred to shamans, mystics, Spiritualists, possessed people, those suffering 
from poltergeist activity, alien abductees and qigong practitioners as belonging to 
particular 'groups', but this word is being used merely for convenience. Members of 
1 See Appendix for a list of interviewees. 


--- Page 22 ---

13 
these so-called groups may vary significantly in their beliefs and behaviour. For 
example/while the Spiritualists who I have interviewed mostly live in Western 
Australia, they come from a variety of Spiritualist churches (see Cartwright, 2003), 
and some of the interviewed qigong instructors also teach yoga and other traditions. 
1.6 
Terminology 
1) Several of the older texts quoted in this thesis — eg: Leroy (1928) and Eliade 
(1951/1989) — do not follow the modern convention of avoiding sexist 
terminology. For example, they may use the word 'man' rather than 'humanity', or 
'he' rather than 'he or she'. I am conscious of this deficiency and intend no offence 
when I use quotations that contain these terms. 
2) Psi: In 1942 the word 'psi' (the twenty-third letter of the Greek alphabet) was 
proposed by the British psychologist R.H. Thouless as a generic term for ESP and PK 
phenomena (Beloff, 1993, p.141) and is now widely used by parapsychologists. 
3) Abbreviations used in this thesis are: 
ASC (altered state of consciousness) 
ESP (extrasensory perception) 
ET (extraterrestrial) 
NDE (near-death experience) 
OBE (out-of-body experience) 
PK (psychokinesis) 
UFO (unidentified flying object) 
1.7 
Outline of Chapters 
Because the main thrust of this research is to carry out a thematic comparison of 
the seven groups that traditionally produce human levitation reports, each of the 
next five chapters documents a particular theme that exists in all or most of the 
groups. Chapter 2 demonstrates that most of the groups believe in a spirit realm 
inhabited by entities or powers that can cause psi events. Chapter 3 reveals that, to 
varying extents and either voluntarily or involuntarily, most groups include members 
who experience some form of spirit possession. Chapter 4 discusses the extent to 
which some group members use breathing exercises or other techniques to enter 
altered states of consciousness, which seem to correlate with psi events. Chapter 5 


--- Page 23 ---

14 
shows that within the seven groups there are people, including some levitators, who 
have a range of other psi abilities. No attempt is made to prove that the reports of 
these other paranormal abilities are true, but their similarities are noted. Chapter 6 
reveals that, in addition to various research obstacles, traditional and modern 
taboos against developing and demonstrating psi abilities exist in most of the 
groups. Chapter 7 discusses some miscellaneous groups or activities that have 
produced some levitation reports and which share several themes with the main 
groups. Chapter 8 summarises the thematic comparison results, discusses some 
theories produced by the hypothesis-generation component of this project and 
makes some suggestions for further research into human levitation.

Chapter 2 
Spirits and Spirit Realms 
The most obvious similarity between the seven groups that have traditionally 
produced human levitation reports is that, to varying degrees, they believe in the 
existence of spirits, divine beings, or invisible entities that inhabit one or more 
spiritual or other-dimensional realms. People supposedly possessed by malevolent 
spirits or suffering from poltergeist activity may not have previously believed in 
spirits, but those around them frequently conclude that spirits are involved. 
Although their definitions of spirits or otherworld entities may vary — f o r example, 
they may be spirits of the dead, cosmic beings, demigods, or emissaries of an all-
pervasive spiritual force — this chapter documents these groups' beliefs about 
spirits and spirit realms, paying attention to whether they attribute psi events such 
as human levitation to these entities. Where possible, examples of human 
levitation from each group are described including the levitator's beliefs about the 
event. While there may at times be differences between the beliefs of a particular 
group and those of a member who has levitated, I am assuming that in most cases 
the group's beliefs influence any reactions to such an event. 
Documenting beliefs about spirits and the realms they inhabit is not an attempt to 
prove that they exist or that they levitate people, although these possibilities are not 
dismissed. Evidence that spirits exist would not prove that they are responsible for 
psi events. Attributing human levitation to invisible entities is understandable if 
members of a group already believe in them and have no other explanation for the 
event. Since spirits are generally invisible, the problem with such an explanation is 
that it is virtually impossible to prove or disprove their existence, let alone their 
capacity to levitate people. 
In discussing these groups and their beliefs, I acknowledge that there may be a 
difference in outlook between group members and researchers; for example, most 
of the available information on shamanism is written by anthropologists — who may 
be sceptical of psi abilities—-rather than by shamans, for whom it is part of their 
worldview. Similarly, some ufologists also claim to be alien abductees, and this 
might undermine their objectivity in the eyes of their colleagues. In most religions 
some participants have dogmatic beliefs while researchers are generally more 
open-minded. Poltergeist investigators, for example, may be prepared to alter their 


--- Page 25 ---

16 
theories in the light of new research, whereas a Spiritualist might not be prepared to 
do so. On the other hand, many academics deny the existence of psi abilities while 
many group members believe in them. In discussing these groups I will be quoting 
a mixture of religious and secular opinions about spirits, spirit realms and psi 
abilities. 
2.1 
Shamanism 
Mircea Eliade (1951/1989) writes that "the experience of height und ascent, and 
even of levitation ... can be regarded as a typical feature of shamanic techniques in 
general" (p.61). He tells us that in Tungus seances, "The shaman becomes 'light' 
and can spring into the air with a costume that may weigh as much as sixty-five 
pounds [29.5 kg], yet the patient scarcely feels the shaman tread on his body" 
(p.243), although it is unclear whether this refers to mass control, levitation or both. 
As anthropologist Michael Harner explains, a belief in spirits and spirit realms lies at 
the heart of shamanism. 
To perform his work, the shaman depends on special, personal power, 
which is usually supplied by his guardian and helping spirits. Each 
shaman generally has at least one guardian spirit in his service, 
whether or not he also possesses helping spirits. (Harner, 1990, p.42) 
The animistic perspective which permeates shamanism assumes that the world 
abounds with spirits and that appeasing some of them can bring positive benefits to 
oneself and others. Nevill Drury asserts that 
shamanism is really applied animism, or animism in practice. Because 
nature is alive with gods and spirits, and because all aspects of the 
cosmos are perceived as interconnected... the shaman is required as 
an intermediary between the different planes of being. (Drury, 1996, 
p.10) 
Shamans can be seen as power-brokers between this world and the spirit realms in 
which they believe. Having learnt to enter these realms during their initiation 
experiences, shamans develop the ability to move between these worlds at will. 
They normally do this while in a state of ecstasy or altered state of consciousness 
(ASC), which will be discussed in a subsequent chapter. Shamans may recruit 
spirits to assist them in their healing work, which is generally considered their most 
important activity. This illustrates that one of the fundamental beliefs of 
shamanism is that spirits can make psi or magical events happen in this world. 
Eliade (1951/1989) reports that shamans believe that "the universe in general is 


--- Page 26 ---

17 
conceived as having three levels — sky, earth, underworld — connected by a 
central axis" (p.259), and that these 
three great cosmic regions... can be successively traversed because 
they are linked together by a central axis. This axis, of course, passes 
through an 'opening', a 'hole'; it is through this hole that the gods 
descend to earth and the dead to the subterranean regions; it is 
through the same hole that the soul of the shaman in ecstasy can fly up 
or down in the course of his celestial or infernal journeys. (Eliade, 
1951/1989, p.259) 
Anthropologist Piers Vitebsky explains why shamans learn to access these realms. 
The shaman's activity is based on ideas of space, and although the 
everyday world is permeated by spirits there are also other, separate 
realms to which shamans must travel. If one assumes that spirits exist, 
and that they exist in a different realm from ours and reach out to 
affect our health and food supply, then it follows that when these things 
are disrupted someone must travel into the realm of the spirits to 
persuade them to behave differently. (Vitebsky, 1995, p.15) 
Vitebsky also points out that in shamanism everything may be seen as "imbued with 
spirit" or that the term spirit "sometimes seems better translated as the 'essence' 
of a phenomenon," or spirits may be regarded "as having their own existence" 
(p.12). Ethnologist Holger Kalweit (1992) notes that in many tribal societies terms 
to describe the concept of universal energy can "refer to God, to being as a whole, 
and equally to the helping spirits who aid shamans into other zones of 
consciousness or in healing" (p.229). 
Although human levitation is not an important or well-documented event in 
shamanism, it can often be rather confusing as to whether descriptions of shamans 
flying are referring to spirit flight, levitation or both. In a section entitled "Magical 
Flight," Eliade (1951/1989, p.477) points out that "all over the world the same 
magical power is credited to sorcerers and medicine men". He emphasises that 
the point of primary importance here is that the mythology and the rites 
of magical flight peculiar to shamans and sorcerers confirm and 
proclaim their transcendence in respect to the human condition; by 
flying into the air, in bird form or in their normal human shape, 
shamans as it were proclaim the degeneration of humanity. For as we 
have seen, a number of myths refer to a primordial time when all 
human beings could ascend to heaven, by climbing a mountain, a tree, 
or a ladder, or by flying by their own power, or being carried by birds. 
(Eliade, 1951/1989, p.480) 
It may seem uncertain whether Eliade's use of the term 'magical flight' refers to the 
flight of the shaman's soul, physical levitation, or both, but he clarifies the matter by 
noting that 


--- Page 27 ---

18 
a universal belief, amply documented in Europe, gives wizards and 
witches the ability to fly through the air. We have seen that the same 
magical powers are credited to yogins, fakirs, and alchemists. We 
should make it clear, however, that here such powers often take on a 
purely spiritual character. (Eliade, 1951/1989, p.478) 
Later he reminds us that "the levitation of saints and magicians is also attested in 
both the Christian and Islamic traditions" (p.481) and quotes the "outstanding 
example" of St Joseph of Cupertino (p.482). Eliade appears to be allowing for the 
possibility of human levitation while emphasising that, more often than not, 
shamans leave their physical bodies behind when they fly to spirit realms. 
The ambiguity of the term 'spirit flight' occurs elsewhere. Knud Rasmussen 
(1931/1976) provides the following story from an Eskimo shaman called Samik: 
My grandfather was from Netsilik Land; he was very fond of going out 
on spirit flights, and once when he was out there he met another great 
shaman from Utkuhikjalik, a man named Muraoq, who was also out on 
a spirit flight. They met far out over the sea ice, about midway between 
their villages. When the two met, Muraoq spread out his arms like a 
bird gliding on its wings, but he was incautious and came so close to 
Titqatsaq that they collided in the air; they crashed together so violently 
that Titqatsaq fell down on the ice. He lay there without being able to 
move until Muraoq turned back and got his helping spirit to help him up 
again. Scarcely had Titqatsaq got up into the air again when he 
returned the compliment and crashed against Muraoq, so that he, too, 
dropped on the ice. At first he thought of leaving him without helping 
him up; but then he recalled how often Muraoq had been good to him; 
that was why he took pity on him and helped him up in exactly the 
same way as he himself had been helped up; and when they got home 
they told the people at their villages all that had happened. 
(Rasmussen, 1931/1976, p.299) 
While the term 'spirit flight' in Rasmussen's report could refer to the flight of a 
shaman's spirit, in this instance I believe it means physical levitation. Rasmussen's 
report includes a drawing of one shaman standing on the ground waving to the 
other who is flying above him (in Halifax, 1982, p.24). Joan Halifax's description of 
this incident suggests that the shamans were amusing themselves by levitating: "In 
ascents to the celestial regions, the shaman attempts to turn into a bird and fly.... 
The shaman may attempt such flights for the good of the community or out of 
pleasure" (Halifax, 1982, p.23). When Titqatsaq fell onto the ice, Muraoq "got his 
helping spirit to help him up again," implying that a shaman's helping spirit can 
facilitate levitation. The physical nature of these shamans' spirit flight is 
emphasised both by the fact that the collisions took place at a specific geographical 


--- Page 28 ---

19 
location and that they caused each shaman to fall onto the sea ice. It seems 
unlikely that two shamans flying in an out-of-body state would collide and fall down. 
As mentioned earlier, this research seeks to demonstrate that shamans and other 
levitators attribute their psi feats to spiritual entities. Richard Noll (1987) states 
that shamans are 'masters of spirits'. "Spirits are employed to effect changes in 
the shaman himself or in others (as in healing), or to make changes in or receive 
information about the outer physical world" (p.49). Vitebsky (1995, p.66) explains 
that "Shamans cannot function unaided and are dependent for their achievements 
on helpers, so that their feats are not so much superhuman as super-assisted". 
Similarly, Drury (1996, p.42) claims that "spirit guides are perceived as crucial to 
the shaman's resolve and power: a literal embodiment of psychic and magical 
strength". Vitebsky (1995) notes that a wide range of spirit helpers exist, such as 
ancestors, warrior spirits, previous shamans, or animals, and that "tools and 
weapons may have their own spirits". Spirit helpers may warn the shaman about 
future obstacles or dangers and "often they provide the shaman with magical 
abilities or strengths which correspond to their own properties" (p.66). Animal 
spirits may provide the shaman with useful abilities that are not available to other 
humans. For example, "A jaguar spirit will make a shaman strong and fierce.... Bird 
and fish spirits enable a shaman to move freely through air and water" (Vitebsky, 
1995, p.67). This demonstrates that shamans believe not only in spirit realms, but 
also that their inhabitants can facilitate psi events. 
2.2 
Poltergeist Activity 
At times it may be difficult to distinguish poltergeist activity from spirit possession 
because both appear to be involuntary and may involve objects and people being 
thrown around. The most obvious difference is that in spirit possession the person 
is clearly not behaving normally whereas in poltergeist activity it may not be obvious 
that anyone is the epicentre of the activity. Cases of poltergeist activity are 
infrequent and may be poorly documented, sometimes because those involved 
have no idea what is happening. The 1977 Enfield poltergeist outbreak in England 
is one of the best documented cases in modern times because one of the primary 
investigators, Guy Playfair (1980), wrote a book about it1. There were four children 
in the family concerned, but the activity appeared to concentrate on eleven-year-old 
1 Some of the recordings and photographs taken during the Enfield poltergeist outbreak can be 
found under 'Poltergeist' at http://www.zurichmansion.org

20 
Janet. Many of the strange and frightening things that happened in the house were 
witnessed, photographed or tape-recorded by investigators (Enfield, 2004). An 
invisible force hurled Janet out of bed on at least fifty occasions (Playfair, 1980, 
p.105). One photograph shows her in mid-air as she flies across the room (p.129). 
Another time, before several witnesses, Janet was thrown from her chair for about 
two and a half metres (Playfair, 1980, p.89). Researchers eventually found that the 
spirit(s) that seemed to be causing the events could reply out loud when questioned 
(Playfair, 1980, p.132; Wilson, 1981, p.241), so they termed it, or them, the 'Voice'. 
On one occasion, an investigator, David Robertson, challenged the Voice to levitate 
Janet. The Voice would not permit the investigators to witness the event, but from 
outside the bedroom Janet was heard being bounced up and down on the bed. She 
said that she had levitated and also floated through the wall into the neighbouring 
house. The Voice declined to repeat the event, but a book (ironically called Fun and 
Games for Children) that had been in Janet's bedroom a few minutes earlier was 
found on the floor next door (Playfair, 1980, p.153; Wilson, 1981, p.243). A 
neighbour walking by outside testified that, when looking at Janet's window, she 
had seen "books and cushions striking the window, and Janet rising into the air— 
in a horizontal position — and descending again, as if being bounced on a 
trampoline" (Wilson, 1981, p.244). To test for fraud, the researchers tried bouncing 
on Janet's bed to see if they could replicate this feat, but were unable to do so. 
Household objects may be seen to move through the air, or materialise in mid-air, 
during poltergeist activity. Sometimes they even appear to move through walls or 
the ceiling. In their analysis of five hundred poltergeist reports, British 
para psychologists Alan Gauld and Tony Cornell (1979, p.227) found that thirty-three 
cases (6.6%) involved levitation of the human body, although it appears that in most 
of them the person is thrown through the air rather than hovering in one place. 
Guiley (1991) defines a poltergeist as "a spirit, usually mischievous and sometimes 
malevolent, which manifests by making noises, moving objects, and assaulting 
people and animals" (p.455). She explains that the word 'poltergeist' comes from 
the German word poltern meaning 'to knock' and geist meaning 'spirit'. Cassirer 
(1988, p.51) claims that the correct meaning of the word is "boisterous spirit". 
Whichever translation one favours, both reveal that poltergeist activity was 
traditionally thought to be caused by invisible spirits. Early last century, researchers 
such as the psychoanalyst Nandor Fodor (1933/1966) started to suspect that a 


--- Page 30 ---

more complex explanation was required. Having initially defined poltergeists as 
"noisy spirits, causing periodic psychic disturbances of a malicious character in 
certain places in the presence of a certain mostly unsuspecting sensitive person" 
(p.291), Fodor (1958) writes that, "It has taken me many years to arrive at the 
conclusion that the poltergeist disturbance may represent an episodic mental 
aberration ... arising from a severe traumatisation and consequent dissociation" 
(p.7). Similarly, Loyd Auerbach claims that 
as models for psychic functioning in the living came into better focus 
(especially ideas of mind influencing matter) parapsychologists were 
better able to understand just what was happening. The concept of the 
poltergeist as somehow related to a human agent... came into being, 
and currently this is the main model that we work with. (Auerbach, 
1986, p.34) 
Cassirer (1988) explains that an alternative term for poltergeist activity, Recurrent 
Spontaneous Psychokinesis (RSPK), "suggests that all such cases are (a) 'person-
centred', and (b) explicable in terms of human energies. In other words, the 
underlying idea is that of an unconsciously-acting medium or 'epicentre'" (p.51). 
Radin (1997) defines poltergeists as "large-scale psychokinetic phenomena 
previously attributed to spirits but now associated with a living person, frequently an 
adolescent" (p.15). However, as Irwin (1994, p.201) notes/although there is some 
experimental evidence to support the idea that RSPK may be "due to the 
subconscious release of PK as a release from considerable psychological tension," 
the theory has by no means been proven. Colin Wilson (1994) has been "converted 
from the notion that poltergeists are simply a form of 'spontaneous psychokinesis', 
due to the hidden power of the unconscious mind, to the conviction that they are 
independent spirits" (p.552). To explain, he quotes a conversation with Playfair, 
who combines the noisy spirits and psychic projection theories, referring to the 
resulting hybrid as a "football of energy": 
When people get into conditions of tension, they exude a kind of energy 
— the kind of thing that happens to teenagers at puberty. Along come 
a couple of spirits, and they do what any group of schoolboys would do 
—they begin to kick it around, smashing windows and generally 
creating havoc. Then they get tired and leave it. In fact the football 
often explodes, and turns into a puddle of water, (in Wilson, 1994, 
p 554) 
Playfair acknowledges that RSPK may operate at times: "I'm not saying there's not 
such a thing as spontaneous psychokinesis. But most poltergeists are spirits" (in 
Wilson, 1994, p.555). It is not part of this research to attempt to validate the RSPK

theory as opposed to the noisy spirits theory. The fact that both theories are still on 
the table reflects the complexity of attempting to explain human levitation, because 
they apply equally to that phenomenon as well. Some people claim to have been 
V 
levitated by spirits, while others appear able to levitate themselves using PK. 
However, claiming that a psi event is the product of PK fails to explain how it works, 
or whether the energy involved is internally or externally generated, or some other 
alternative for which we at present have no accepted scientific concept. 
Irwin (2004) provides several reasons to suspect that some sort of intelligence may 
be behind many poltergeist cases. Investigators can at times communicate with 
whatever seems to be causing the poltergeist chaos. Apparitions are sometimes 
seen; objects may move through the air as if they are being carried; the activity is 
sometimes directed at only one person; and sometimes "exorcism may be 
successful in attenuating the disturbance" (p.158). Gauld and Cornell (1979, 
p.227) found that "communication through phenomena" occurred in 16% of the 
cases they reviewed; supposedly deceased persons communicated in 9% of the 
cases; and in an additional 2% of cases the communication came from some other 
type of entity. This does not prove that spirits cause poltergeist activity because 
these events could be projections from a living person's unconscious mind. 
Obviously more research is needed. Claiming that poltergeist activity is caused by 
noisy spirits or unconscious PK could be seen as replacing one mystery with 
another, although PK is currently being researched by some parapsychologists. On 
the other hand, many scientists are sceptical about the reality of spirits, or they lack 
a suitable methodology with which to investigate them. Irwin cleverly sums up the 
matter: "Conceptually the poltergeist is subject to the Zeitgeist" (2004, p.161). 
2.3 
Spiritualism 
Fodor (1933/1966) claims that "There are two basic facts in spiritualism: the 
continuity of personality and the powers of communication after death" (p.360). In 
1848 the Fox sisters, Maggie and Katie, from Hydesville, New York, started to 
demonstrate their ability to communicate with spirits. Because of the 
unprecedented public interest in the phenomenon, the girls' older sister, Leah, 
turned them into a stage act and at their seances they began to communicate with 
the spirits of famous people. The movement soon expanded across America and to 
Europe. Spiritualism may only have started in the last two hundred years but, as 
parapsychologist John Beloff (1993) notes, archaeological evidence suggests that a 


--- Page 32 ---

23 
belief in an afterlife has existed for thousands of years and it is still a fundamental 
tenet of all major religions. Although the practice of communicating with the dead 
has been at the heart of shamanism for thousands of years, "all three of the great 
monotheistic religions frowned upon such practices, and none so more than the 
Christian Church" (Beloff, 1993, p.38). Spiritualism, however, encourages such 
communication. Based in Manchester, England, the Spiritualists National Union 
(SNU) is one of the two largest Spiritualists organizations in the world. It 
affirms that man's spirit survives physical death and enters a Spirit 
world which surrounds and interpenetrates our material life. It asserts 
that the truth of this statement can be demonstrated under the right 
conditions when communication can and does take place between the 
worlds of spiri't and earthly beings. This communication is only possible 
through individuals who have what is known as mediumistic abilities 
and who are known as mediums. (Meynell, 1998, para.6) 
Spirit mediums fall into two categories, mental or physical. A mental medium 
communicates with spirits using ESP and it is this type of mediumship that is 
demonstrated most often in public. Physical mediumship is rarer, more dramatic, 
and "is characterised by levitations, rappings, apports, telekinesis of objects, 
psychic lights, music and smells, and other activities" (Guiley, 1991, p.571). 
Allan Kardec, whose real name was Hypolyte [or Hyppolite] Rivail (1803-1869), was 
a French doctor and author of The Spirits' Book (1856/1989). Kardec accumulated 
a wealth of information about spirits through various mediums. Although the terms 
'soul' and 'spirit' are sometimes used interchangeably in Western society today, 
Kardec (1856/1989) defines them differently. 'Soul' is the "immaterial and 
individual being which resides in us, and survives the body" (p.23), while spirits or 
genii are the beings that communicate with us through mediums (p.31). Kardec 
uses quotations from various spirits to clarify this distinction: 
The spirit-world is the normal, primitive, eternal world, pre-existent to, 
and surviving, everything else.... Spirits temporarily assume a 
perishable material envelope, the destruction of which by death, 
restores them to liberty. ... The soul is an incarnated spirit, whose body 
is only its envelope.... A spirit, therefore, is not an abstract, undefined 
being, only to be conceived of by our thought; it is a real, circumscribed 
being. (Kardec, 1856/1989, p.32) 
To explain the psi events that occur in the presence of physical mediums, Kardec 
claims that spirits 
are everywhere, in space, and around us, seeing us, and mixing with us 
incessantly.... They act both upon matter and upon thought, and 
constitute one of the powers of nature, the efficient cause of many 


--- Page 33 ---

24 
classes of phenomena hitherto unexplained or misinterpreted. (Kardec, 
1856/1989, p.34) 
Beloff (1993, p.40) distinguishes between the life-after-death argument that 
Spiritualists espouse and the psi phenomena that occur at seances. Empirically it is 
easier to research a medium's PK abilities than it is to conclude that purported 
messages from the dead constitute proof of survival. Nevertheless, as Braude 
(1986) writes, although "physical mediumship is only one source of evidence for 
large-scale PK," he believes that "It is simply the best, as far as the quality and 
amount of documentation is concerned" (p.169). 
Victorian seances were often conducted in darkness or semi-darkness because it 
was believed that spirits preferred it, and because it was easier to see the 
anomalous luminous phenomena that sometimes appeared (Braude, 1986, p.73). 
Some early researchers into Spiritualism, such as Sir William Crookes, were not 
entirely convinced that spirits were responsible and proposed the existence of a 
'psychic force' (in Beloff, 1993, p.51). Others were convinced that all spirit 
mediums were cheating, and some fraudulent mediums were unmasked or 
voluntarily confessed (eg: Lamar Keene, 1977). While darkness can facilitate all 
kinds of hoaxes, there were some physical mediums — such as D.D. Home, who 
often worked in daylight or low lighting—who were never caught cheating or whose 
psi feats were so extraordinary that fraud seems unlikely. 
There are several mediums who have supposedly levitated. Playfair describes the 
feats of Brazilian medium Carmine Mirabelli, born in 1889. Mirabelli once 
levitated into the air while handcuffed, whereupon there was a sound of 
falling handcuffs as he disappeared altogether, reappearing in his 
nearby office which was locked from the outside, where startled 
witnesses burst in to find him stretched out on a chaise longue and 
chanting away in Latin. (Playfair, 1995, p.7) 
Psi events happened around Mirabelli when he was not at a seance. Fodor 
(1933/1966) reports that he was once seen to levitate "in the street two metres 
high for three minutes" (p.243). The famous Italian medium, Eusapia Palladino 
(1854-1918), was also seen levitating several times during seances (Giovetti, 
1995, p.28). "The greatest physical medium in the history of modern spiritualism" 
(Fodor, 1933/1966, p.171) was D.D. Home (1833-1886), whose psi exploits — 
including numerous levitations — are documented in popular books and more

25 
scholarly works (Beloff, 1989; Braude, 1986; Broughton, 1991; Crookes, 
1874/1972; Dingwell, 1947/1962; Fodor, 1933/1966; Inglis, 1986; Irwin, 1994), 
as well as in his autobiography (Home, 1863/1972). As Braude (1986) notes, 
"during the entire period of Home's mediumship — a period of almost 25 years — 
he was never detected in fraud of any kind" (p.72). The following report comes from 
Crookes, who spent a considerable amount of time investigating Spiritualism 
despite being ridiculed by many of his sceptical colleagues. 
The most striking cases of levitation which I have witnessed have been 
with Mr Home. On three separate occasions have I seen him raised 
completely from the floor of the room. Once sitting on an easy chair, 
once knseling on his chair, and once standing up. On each occasion I 
had full opportunity of watching the occurrence as it v/as taking place. 
(Crookes, 1874/1972, p.89) 
Home's autobiography contains several testimonies. One, written by an American 
seance participant, describes what Home claims is his first levitation. 
Suddenly... Mr Home was taken up into the air! I had hold of his hand 
at the time, and I and others felt his feet — they were lifted a foot from 
the floor!... Again and again he was taken from the floor, and the third 
time he was carried to the lofty ceiling of the apartment, with which his 
hand and head came in gentle contact, (in Home, 1863/1972, p.38) 
To illustrate his belief that the levitation was facilitated by spirits, the witness adds 
that "these latter demonstrations were made in response to a request of mine that 
the spirits would give us something that would satisfy everyone in the room of their 
presence" (p.39). These examples illustrate that, not only do Spiritualists believe 
that spirits exist in a realm that interpenetrates physical reality, but that they can 
cause psi events such as human levitation. 
For this research I interviewed several Spiritualists who claim to have either 
levitated themselves or witnessed someone else do it. Edward1 is an experienced 
spirit medium who lived for many years in England and now resides in Western 
Australia. The first levitation he witnessed was at a small get-together of about six 
spirit mediums and one "interested person" who was about 18 years old, in a 
normally lit room. After a while, without anyone attempting to cause it, the "ordinary 
kitchen chair" with the interested person on it lifted "a good six inches [15 cm] off 
the ground" for "over a minute". In Edward's opinion, the levitation of the guest was 
the spirits' way of saying "Look, we're here to assist and to show you what we can 
do." In Edward's second example he was with a group of people who were trying to

26 
levitate someone who "was lying down on a healing couch". At first they were 
laughing and didn't think they were going to succeed. But then, 
we'd all quietened down and you could feel the presence of people that 
the average person couldn't see. Spirits, yes. And they simply lifted 
him up, and he was a good foot [30 cm] off the bed ... and kept there 
for nearly five minutes. Horizontal. 
The levitator "was wide awake and quite willing... because we were talking at the 
same time. 'What do you feel?' We were asking questions." Edward reports that, 
not surprisingly, the levitator said that 
he felt very light, extremely light.... He felt tingles all over his body. It 
wasn't harming him, he just felt this tingling sensation, even in his ears, 
in his head. His eyes were quite clear, there was no problem at all. So 
we said'Okay, fine. Let's let him down.' And it took a while.... There 
was not a sudden bump. It was gentle and comfortable. 
In Edward's third example, he and some Spiritualist friends decided to levitate a 
young man in a different way from the previous two occasions. "He was laying on 
his tummy, on the ground.... And again it took time. The energies built up ... you 
could feel them coming up.... Up this person came. Beautiful." Still face down in 
the horizontal position, the levitator rose about "three feet" [91 cm] for "between 8, 
9,10 minutes. And they turned him so gently," before lowering him to the ground. 
A second interviewee, Maude, once held a senior position in a Perth Spiritualist 
Church, but is now semi-retired. Her Church has a strong affiliation with Christianity 
and holds the Bible in high regard. Maude claims to have been levitated several 
times during her long career as a medium although, instead of using the terms spirit 
medium and seance, she says that she used to lead an open 'circle' or guided 
meditation group of about 10 to 15 people. She would verbally guide the 
participants through a meditative visualisation "up a mountain, at the beach or into 
a small spiritual imaginative area". She relates that several times at these circles, 
"I have actually felt myself lifted up and, because I believe in divine protection, I've 
called for protection and on a couple of occasions I've been brought back down ... 
other times I've been held in that position". On another occasion, after she had 
finished talking and the participants were sitting quietly meditating, she found 
herself being lifted off her chair to a height of "about 30 centimetres" in a normally 
lit room ("we don't meditate in the dark") for "probably something like 5, 6, [or] 7 
minutes". Maude believes both in God and spiritual entities. When asked why 
some people can see spiritual beings and some cannot, she replies that 


--- Page 36 ---

27 
I can only say to people, that if you work in the right way you will be able 
to see them. It's to do with ... the gift of clairvoyance [with] which you 
can either feel them, hear them speak: all the normal senses can be 
activated, plus the sixth sense where you can become aware of them. I 
have heard them, I have seen them, I have felt them. 
Several of the Spiritualists interviewed for this research used the term 'spirit' in 
what appears to be a generic or collective sense. Asked what they meant by this, 
Elizabeth explains that her 
belief is that spirit is energy.... To me the individual spirits are part of 
the one God entity, being a massive ball of energy, or that energy we 
put a name to as 'spirit'.... The peak of the mountain I see as like a big 
ball of energy which is God. Perfect essence, perfect spirit. And that 
then ... sends off other spirits or parts of it to experience things on this 
Earth plane. 
Garry uses the term 'spirit' to refer to either spirits in general, the energy of the 
spirit realm, or his spirit guides. For example, if something unusual happens to him 
before he leaves the house, he might conclude that "spirit was probably telling me 
'Don't go out today'". Richard explains that "Spirit to me is a basic vibration of 
human life.... A spirit would be an individual, as we are individuated humans.... But 
the total consciousness of life to me is spirit". In a similar sense, Barbara claims 
that "God to us is a great spirit". Oliver, too, has a dual interpretation of the word 
spirit, "I see it in two ways: as an individual and of a spiritual energy power". Fred 
explains that "We're talking of spirit as a force. The spirit force.... and that's why 
we always talk about spirit and not spirits". Fred adds that 
We believe that God is a supreme spirit, or a spirit that created 
everybody.... Somebody else might call it another name, all the 
religions have got their own name, but I think that they're all really 
looking [at] the spirit, or the creator. 
So far, the evidence reveals that within shamanism, poltergeist activity and 
Spiritualism there is a belief in another dimension or realm inhabited by spirits that 
can facilitate psi events such as levitation. Some members of these groups link psi 
events to an all-pervasive spiritual force that seems able to operate voluntarily, 
involuntarily, or unconsciously through the human mind, which suggests a link 
between consciousness and this spirit realm. This raises the question of whether a 
belief in spirits is simply a personification of this spiritual force or whether they are 
two different phenomena.

2.4 
Alien Abductions 
The term 'alien abduction' is commonly used to describe interactions between 
humans and extraterrestrials, but some abductees claim that what they prefer to 
call their 'close encounters' with aliens are largely voluntary and that they look 
forward to repeat encounters. While acknowledging these concerns, I will for 
convenience continue to use both terms. Research into ufology, which includes 
close encounters, is a fairly new science. For about the last fifty years UFOs, aliens 
and more recently alien abductions, have been the subject of ridicule and 
sensational tabloid journalism, and ufology has not been regarded as a valid 
subject for academic research. For much of this time the ufology literature 
consisted largely of poorly referenced books and magazine articles with only a small 
number of scholarly works. Today there is an increasing amount of serious ufology 
research being published (eg: Jacobs, 2000), some of which has noted similarities 
between close encounters and religion, shamanism, Spiritualism, spirit possession 
and poltergeist activity (eg: Harvey-Wilson, 2000; Mack, 1995, 2000). Some of 
these links will be discussed in later chapters, while this section will provide 
examples of abductees levitating, and discuss to what extent ufologists and 
abductees believe that aliens can be seen as spiritual beings with psi abilities from 
other-dimensional realms. 
Alien abductees are not a coherent group in the same sense as Spiritualists, 
Christians or shamans. They come from all walks of life and age groups (Rodwell, 
1998) and, if they meet at all, it may only be at abduction support groups or UFO 
conferences. There is no religious literature or tradition from which they draw their 
beliefs, although many of them have a high regard for the books of sympathetic 
abduction researchers such as Mack (1995, 2000). Abductees may not have been • 
actively religious or believed in spirits before their abductions, but often have a 
history of psychic experiences, which might have primed them to accept the 
existence of invisible entities or to project their spiritual beliefs onto aliens. Many 
abductees are initially traumatised and bewildered but may become more accepting 
of their encounters after meeting an abduction counsellor or other experiences. As 
discussed in some of my previous research, theories about the origins of UFOs and 
aliens fall into three main categories (Harvey-Wilson, 2000, p.20). 
1) The Extraterrestrial Hypothesis (ETH) which claims that UFOs are extraterrestrial 
spacecraft from elsewhere within the physical universe. Some researchers 


--- Page 38 ---

29 
object to this theory because of the prohibitive distances from Earth to any 
possibly inhabited planets, while others assert that any sufficiently advanced 
civilisation would have surmounted these problems. Other critics claim that the 
overall frequency and bizarre psi nature or 'strangeness' of UFO close 
encounters require a more complex explanation than visiting spaceships. 
2) The second hypothesis, called variously the Psychosocial Stress, Psychic 
Projection, or Cosmic Poltergeist Hypothesis, states that UFOs and aliens are 
some type of archetypal or psychic projection from within either the troubled 
unconscious minds of individual witnesses, or the collective unconscious of a 
society that has become psychologically unbalanced — hence the term 
psychosocial stress. One objection to this theory is that it does not explain 
supposed UFO landing traces or how some UFOs have been detected by radar. 
3) The third hypothesis is the Otherworld Hypothesis which suggests that UFOs may 
well be real or solid in some sense, but that they originate from other 
dimensions, a parallel universe, or an invisible otherworld inhabited by various 
spiritual or psi entities that can manifest in this world at will to abduct or interact 
with witnesses. The hypothesis includes the suggestion that this otherworld is 
accessible to humans via ASCs. One difficulty with this hypothesis is that an 
explanation for close encounters that appeals to an invisible, magical, or 
spiritual realm and ASCs merely replaces one mystery with another. 
There are several variations to these three hypotheses, with some researchers 
discussing all of them impartially, while others strongly advocate one or another. 
The Otherworld Hypothesis is in one sense just an extension of the Psychosocial 
Stress Hypothesis in that both involve largely unproven speculation about the 
depths of the human psyche and ASCs. One could say that both hypotheses result 
from uncertainty as to whether there really exists something akin to Dr Carl Jung's 
collective unconscious and if so, what its parameters are. For example, is the 
collective unconscious each person's private repository of archetypal information, or 
are all minds somehow connected by a transpersonal but largely unconscious realm 
— possibly inhabited by independent entities—that holds the key to all sorts of psi 
anomalies, including alien abductions? Another way of putting this question is to 
ask whether science should be investigating an open model of the human mind 
rather than the traditional closed one.

30 
Several researchers have written about the religious, spiritual or otherworldly 
behaviour of UFOs and aliens. The respected ufologist Dr Jacques Vallee 
(1969/1993) claims that for centuries European folklore has described anomalous 
otherworld beings that occasionally interact with humans. Whether called gnomes, 
leprechauns, elves, or fairies, they appear to act in ways reminiscent of today's 
aliens. To help explain "the abductions and the psychic component" Vallee (1990a, 
p.284), writes: 
I believe that the UFO phenomenon represents evidence for other 
dimensions beyond spacetime; the UFOs may not come from ordinary 
space, but from a multiverse which is all around us, and of which we 
have stubbornly refused to consider the disturbing reality in spite of the 
evidence available to us for centuries. (Vallee, 1990a, p.284) 
Similarly, Keith Thompson (1993) suggests that there may exist "intermediate 
states of reality.... Perhaps UFOs are temporary formations of psychic or quasi-
psychic material independent of individual psyches, originating from corridors 
beyond our time-space coordinates yet in effect 'right here'" (p.45). Patrick Harpur 
(1994) claims that throughout history humans have interacted with otherworld 
entities who are capable of masquerading in a variety of guises such as spirits, 
guardian angels, demonic entities or aliens. 
Richard Thompson (1993) compares UFO phenomena with the ancient Vedic 
literature of India. He points out that "mystical contacts with higher beings have 
been standard since time immemorial, and these contacts are said to still go on 
today" (p.212). He claims that Vedic literature describes anomalous aerial vehicles 
called vimanas which "had flight characteristics resembling those reported for 
UFOs, and the beings associated with them were said to possess powers similar to 
those presently ascribed to UFO entities" (p.214). Furthermore, in Vedic society it 
was believed possible to travel into "higher-dimensional regions" or "to leave the 
material universe altogether and travel through a graded arrangement of 
transcendental realms" (R.L Thompson, 1993, p.214). Joseph Dormer (1993) 
suggests that anomalous beings such as spirits, angels, ghosts, goblins, demons, 
fairies and aliens may be "part and parcel of one single and underlying 
phenomenon" (p.142) which could mean that "the origin of all the world's religions 
... might be explicable in terms of such encounters. It might well be that to solve the 
UFO mystery will be to solve a//mysteries" (p.143). Dormer does not subscribe 
entirely to the otherworld hypothesis, but believes that ufologists should investigate 


--- Page 40 ---

31 
whether "it is the collective unconscious operating behind the whole charade" 
(p.152). 
Psychologist Professor Kenneth Ring has investigated the similarities between 
NDEs and UFO close encounters. Ring (1992) found that both groups of 
respondents described experiences similar to shamanic initiations, leading him to 
conclude that "the increasing fascination with and immersion in the domain of 
extraordinary encounters may well presage the shamanizing of modern humanity" 
(p.239). By this he means that "we could be in the beginning stages of a major shift 
in levels of consciousness that will eventually lead to humanity's being able to live 
in two worlds at once—the physical and imaginal" (p.240). Ring (1992) explains 
that the term 'imaginal realm' was "originally proposed by a renowned Islamic 
scholar Henry Corbin in 1972" (p.220), and that not only is the realm "ontologically 
real, it is also a world that has form, dimension, and most important for us, persons 
or entities" (p.221). It seems that Ring and a majority of his respondents subscribe 
to the otherworld hypothesis to explain alien abductions. 
Dr John Mack (2000a) notes that the spiritual aftermath of their alien encounters is 
of major significance to the abductees he has interviewed. Many undergo a 
"spiritual renaissance" (p.221) because they believe that the aliens they encounter 
"seem to have a connection with spirit or Source that we do not have or have lost" 
(p.223). Mack also notes the similarity between close encounters and shamanism: 
Like shamans in their preparatory training or practicing their art, they 
[abductees] are brought by the experiences into nonordinary states of 
consciousness in which space and time lose their defining power and a 
world or worlds of nonhuman spirit beings becomes manifest. (Mack, 
2000a, p.136) 
These quotations demonstrate that many leading ufologists and the abductees they 
have interviewed believe that aliens originate from an inter-dimensional or spiritual 
otherworld. Further examples are to be found in 'channelled' material which has 
supposedly been obtained telepathically from aliens. Lyssa Royal and Keith Priest 
(1992) say they have interviewed several aliens, one of whom claims to "be a 
nonphysical group consciousness" (p.xiv), while others are supposedly physical 
beings from elsewhere in the universe. To conduct the interviews, Royal "puts 
herself into a meditative state" (p.xiv) and co-author Priest or "various other 
individuals attending the private or public gathering" (p.xiv) ask questions which 
Royal then communicates telepathically to an alien. Channelling information from 


--- Page 41 ---

32 
aliens resembles Spiritualists contacting spirits. As Jon Klimo (1991) points out, "In 
the majority of cases ... the aliens claim to come from vibratory domains finer than 
ours, usually from the etheric level between the physical and the supposed astral 
plane of deceased human spirits" (p.178). 
There are three categories of levitation associated with UFOs and aliens. Firstly, 
some abductees report being levitated by aliens or by a beam of light from a UFO, or 
having seen aliens levitate during their close encounters. Secondly, a small number 
of abductees report finding themselves levitating spontaneously after their 
abduction experiences. Lastly, there are claims that UFO propulsion may involve 
some form of anti-gravity (Childress, 1986), which falls outside the parameters of 
this research project. 
Richard Thompson (1993) quotes an example of the first type of levitation from the 
hypnosis transcripts of the abduction case of Sara Shaw in 1953 near Los Angeles. 
Sara initially describes floating along above the ground with some aliens, but then 
claims to be standing on a smooth, seemingly solid beam of light that is angled up 
like an escalator. "All of us are walking, but in addition, the beam is conveying us. 
The beam is moving" (p.284). Thompson comments that, "it seems that the light 
beam not only nullified Sara's weight but also enabled her to balance herself in an 
upright stance and walk normally" (p.284). This might be a form of human 
levitation, or an example of futuristic levitation or anti-gravity technology which 
enables aliens not only to levitate themselves but others as well, including animals. 
Vallee (1990a) reports that "in 1954 in the French countryside, a man who was 
coming back from the fields with his horse had to let go of the bridle as the animal 
was lifted several feet into the a i r — a dark, circular object was flying over the trail 
they were following" (p.176). As a measure of how often aliens appear to levitate, 
Dan Wright (1994, p.3), who was then the manager of the MUFON1 Abduction 
Transcript Project in the USA, reports that 41% of the transcripts that mention how 
aliens move, describe them as gliding or levitating. 
As an example of the second type of human levitation, Vallee (1990a) describes a 
UFO close encounter case that occurred in November 1968 in the south of France. 
The primary witness, a doctor, underwent changes to his health and attitude to life 
1 The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) is a large American ufology organisation that publishes the 
monthly MUFON UFO Journal. Their website is at www.mufon.com

33 
after the encounter. In addition, "Coincidences of a telepathic nature are frequently 
reported, and the doctor has allegedly, on at least one occasion, experienced 
levitation without being able to control it" (p.176). 
Interviewee Laura, who claims to be a repeat abductee, found herself levitating 
after her initial close encounter experience. She was lying on her bed, fully clothed, 
at 10 pm. Before falling asleep, she felt a powerful energy enter her body, starting 
on the right side of her head. "This is energy that I felt every day for the last three 
years. It touches all parts of my body." The energy increased in intensity "and then 
I started to rise off the bed". Laura thinks that she rose, in the horizontal position, 
"about a foot [30 cm]" above the bed. "The energy started to die down, very, very 
slowly and I started to come down ... until [I felt] the sensation of my back and 
bottom hitting the mattress... until I was right back down into the mattress, feeling 
heavy again." The energy increased in intensity and for a second time she rose 
"about a metre" off the bed and then again slowly sank back onto the mattress. 
She calculates that she was in the air for about thirty seconds on the first occasion 
and "I'd say 60 to 80 seconds the second time". For a third time the energy 
intensified and she rose off the bed but promptly lost consciousness except for brief 
memories of another abduction experience. The first two levitations may have been 
aborted abduction attempts and the energy she felt could have been caused by an 
external agency. Aliens may have been trying to 'lift' Laura out of her body or even 
teleport her, but, because she physically levitated, they stopped and tried again 
until it worked. When asked about her belief in spirits and otherworld beings Laura 
replied that, "I can feel and sense spirits around me.... There's dead humans, I 
sense dead humans. I sense ETs, I sense celestial beings, angels." She believes 
that everyone has some form of invisible guardian entity but notes that, regarding 
ETs and spirits, "They appear a bit different and I think they come from different 
places." It is interesting to note that both Laura and one of the people that the 
Spiritualist Edward helped levitate, felt an unusual energy or tingling sensation in 
their bodies while being levitated. It is unclear whether this energy comes from 
otherworld entities, from the unconscious mind, or elsewhere. 
In a survey of UFO literature between 1975 and 1999, Australian ufologist Keith 
Basterfield (2001) found a link between UFOs and psi "which many UFO 
researchers have chosen to ignore" (p.30), perhaps because they feared that 
linking together two subjects about which most scientists are highly sceptical would 


--- Page 43 ---

34 
have undermined the credibility of their research. Basterfield discovered that 
"paranormal events mainly happen after a UFO event"; that a "childhood history of 
psychic experiences is often followed by adult UFO encounters"; and that "a high 
proportion of close encounter UFO experients report associated paranormal events" 
(p.53). He also notes the difficulty in ascertaining whether UFOs cause psi events 
or whether they are psi phenomena themselves (p.48). 
In a second project, Basterfield and parapsychologist Dr Michael Thalbourne (2002, 
p.2) compared the "belief in, and alleged experience of, the paranormal (ESP, PK 
and life-after-death)" between a sample of abductees and a control group. Although 
their results showed that the abductees scored significantly higher than the control 
group, they were not specifically asked whether they believed that their close 
encounters caused the psi events they report. This survey notes that psi events 
correlate significantly with abduction experiences, which could mean that some are 
facilitated by aliens. Basterfield and Thalbourne's and my research (Harvey-Wilson, 
2000,2001) found that abductees report psi events and abilities before, during 
and after their close encounters. Some of the subsequent events — such as 
malfunctioning electrical devices — are also reminiscent of poltergeist activity. It is 
still unclear whether people are abducted because they already have psi abilities or 
whether close encounters initiate or enhance those abilities. 
As the Otherworld Hypothesis reveals, the central belief of a significant percentage 
of ufologists and abductees mirrors that of the groups discussed so far; 
shamanism, poltergeist activity and Spiritualism. With minor differences, these 
groups postulate the existence of a spiritual or other-dimensional realm inhabited 
by invisible entities with psi abilities who can facilitate human levitation. 
2.5 
Martial Arts: Qigong 
It may appear paradoxical that martial arts traditions such as qigong have spiritual 
and psi components, because most people in the West associate spirituality and 
meditation with non-violence. But, as Murphy (1992) writes, "For many centuries, 
martial artists have made their training a way... to realise extraordinary capacities. 
Most ideas that inform such training come from Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian, 
Shintoist, and shamanic teachings of the Far East" (p.448). It is these extraordinary 
capacities, some of which apparently involve making oneself heavier or lighter, 


--- Page 44 ---

35 
which are of interest to this research, although the main question being addressed 
in this section is whether these martial arts traditions involve a belief in spirits or 
spiritual powers and spirit realms. Parapsychologist Dr Elmar Gruber (1999) writes 
that qigong has "its roots in spiritual and physical exercises that date back to Taoist 
and Buddhist practices. Qigong means work or exercise with qi [chi]" (p.121). 
Gruber explains that chi is 
A basic term in Chinese medicine, in which it represents a natural force 
that permeates both the universe and man. Its actual meaning is very 
similar to the Hindu prana and the Greek pneuma, which refer to an 
energy that is both physical and mental, a power that both sustains life 
and shapes bodily form, and the direct expression of which is breath, a 
sort of link between the corporeal and the spiritual. (Gruber, 1999, 
p.121) 
Although this definition does not mention spirits, it does refer to an unseen energy 
or force which can manifest in a physical manner. As with Spiritualism, an 
explanation for psi events that involves an impersonal spiritual energy can be 
regarded as analogous to one that involves unseen spirits, minus the 
personification or anthropomorphic component. In 1984 Chinese-American qigong 
instructor Paul Dong (1984, p.145) wrote that few Westerners knew anything about 
qigong. Today/qigong has become more popular in the West, although Maliszewski 
(1996) believes that "the depth of association that many of these disciplines had 
with specific religious traditions has gone unrecognised" (p.20). Like yoga or tai chi, 
qigong classes are largely about gentle bodily movements and focussed breathing, 
rather than concentrating on a belief in spirits and the development of psi abilities. 
Although Dong writes that "This ancient deep breathing technique... is a key to 
developing paranormal abilities, and it has been known to the Chinese for 
centuries" (1984, p.145), traditional qigong practitioners were probably more 
interested in their health than developing psi abilities. Dong and Raffill (1997) 
explain that as well as "health, healing, and longevity" qigong's "powers also 
include the development of the latent potentials of the body" (p.131), which means 
that qigong "also evolved into a technique for strengthening martial arts abilities. 
Martial arts practitioners had to learn qi gong first to give them a solid base of 
energy with which to face their opponents and defend themselves" (p.131). Dong 
and Raffill add that in China, and to an increasing degree in the West, qigong is now 
regarded by the medical profession "as having a very high medicinal value" 
especially for chronic diseases that have no known treatment (p.131). This means 
that qigong is an ancient tradition that can today be used by ordinary people to 
maintain their health and fitness; by doctors to treat chronic diseases; by martial 


--- Page 45 ---

36 
arts practitioners to defend themselves or overcome others in unarmed combat; as 
well as producing in some of these people a wide range of psi abilities, including the 
capacity to levitate. These uses appear to be related because, in conjunction with 
physical fitness, the psi component of qigong may. be what helps heal the sick and 
enhances various advanced martial arts techniques. 
As well as qigong, other martial arts traditions have produced some levitation 
reports, perhaps because, although they have different fighting techniques, their 
basic spiritual practices are similar. As Murphy explained earlier, they have all 
evolved from traditions such as Buddhism or Taoism, although in the West these 
beliefs generally only apply to masters and their advanced students. Taoism 
acknowledges the existence of spirits and a spirit world (Cooper, 1972, p.30), as 
does Buddhism. In addition, Holmes Welch (1966) explains that Taoism was 
gradually influenced by Buddhism and adopted many of its beliefs. Most martial 
arts traditions share the spiritual practice of meditation, in which the participant 
learns "to shift his functioning from the ordinary ego to his deeper nature" (Murphy, 
1992, p.449)'. By combining meditation and movement/ practitioners can 
accumulate or tap into chi during combat. Geoff Pike (1980) writes that 
"Meditation was used to store and release energy at will, to conserve Chi and to 
unleash it with speed and power" (p.136). Trained practitioners can focus this 
energy specifically: "According to martial arts lore, ki [chi] operates in many ways, 
flowing through the arm to strengthen it, massing in the body to increase weight, or 
evanescing to make one lighter" (Murphy, 1992, p.452). Because chi is regarded 
as a universal energy to which anyone can gain personal access, one could argue 
that it has no spiritual qualities, despite the fact that the martial arts derived from 
Buddhism and/or Taoism, and advanced masters frequently include a spiritual 
dimension in their teachings. Dong (1984) favours a scientific approach to 
investigating the psi aspects of qigong and omits references to spirits, although he 
does note that ultimately chi transcends the human body. "Chinese philosophy 
holds that qi [chi] is the primal matrix of creation from which springs the yin and 
yang forces that give rise to substance and material forms" meaning that a qigong 
master "controls the very forces of life" (p.146). He asserts that the ultimate goal of 
mastering chi "is to become one with it so that your entire existence is simply yet 
wonderfully blended with the forces of the universe in a self transcendent manner" 
(Dong, 1984, p.146). Similarly, Morihei Uyeshiba, who founded aikido, claimed that 
"all the universe was one, and that the true aim of the martial arts must therefore 


--- Page 46 ---

37 
be to be in harmony with the universe" (in Barclay, 1973, p.45). One could claim 
that such beliefs are a form of impersonal mysticism. Dong (1997) also notes that, 
especially with respect to healing, "chi is related to the spirit, and chi only appears 
in particular spiritual states. These states are meditation, relaxation, and 
concentration" (p.139). Despite preferring to use impersonal terminology Dong 
nevertheless seems to regard spiritual and psi forces as almost identical. 
"The mysterious component of Asian martial arts is often associated with the 
development of paranormal skills" (Maliszewski, 1996, p.130). Dong (1984) notes 
that there are several terms within qigong to describe the psi abilities that a 
practitioner may develop. "Those who can master nei yang gong can reduce their 
weight—that is they can levitate. To use a more common term ... it is called ching 
gong (lightweight gong)" (p.167). Dong gives an example of a Chinese soldier who 
was filmed in 1981 walking on top of a row of six match boxes and then standing on 
just two without crushing them (p.168). The soldier, who had learned ching gong 
from his grandfather, held his breath while appearing to make himself lighter. Dong 
then provides an example that comes closer to levitation: 
In the Wen Zhou City Hospital in Zhe Jiang Province, there is a seventy-
four-year-old doctor of Chinese medicine called Lin Hung Da. When he 
wants to, he can jump up from the ground and suspend himself in the 
air with only his hands touching a wall. He can even have his back 
touch a wall and by using the back muscles he can crawl higher and 
higher. This amazing art is called bi hu gong, which literally means 'the 
tiger climbing up the wall.'(Dong, 1984, p.167) 
Dong tells us that a second doctor "who works at the Wen Zhou City Si Tai Disease 
Prevention Center, heals patients only by using qi gong.... When he gathers his qi 
[chi] he is able to raise himself from the ground and float in the air" (1984, p.167). 
Finally, Dong describes how in 1981 with some friends in Canton (now Guangzhou) 
he watched a qigong master called Wu Zhen as he "moved up and down in the air 
from his sitting position" (p.167). 
Kosta Danaos (2000, 2002) describes the exploits and teachings of his Chinese-
Javanese neikung master John Chang, who "is the Headmaster of a kung fu lineage 
whose roots can be traced back twenty-four hundred years" (Danaos, 2000, p.8). 
Quoting his master's teachings, Danaos writes that "It is difficult to say where one 
ends and the other begins, but essentially ch'ikung [qigong] centers on the 
development and control of yang ch'i... while neikung involves the joint employment 


--- Page 47 ---

38 
of yang ch'i and yin ch'i" (p.21). Neikung is a higher form of qigong because "Ymg 
ch'i cannot pass beyond the confines of the physical body, while yin ch'i can and so 
may impart to the practitioner preternatural abilities such as those demonstrated by 
Master Chang" (p.22). Likewise, Daniel Reid (1998) explains that neikung is the 
'internal alchemy' of qigong in which, through practice such as meditatipn, an 
adept's essence can be transformed into spiritual powers such as ESP and PK 
(pp.81-84). While explaining to Danaos (2000) that a mastery of chi facilitates 
numerous psi abilities, Master Chang mentioned human levitation, saying: "It took 
me only a few months to learn that trick.... You just rise up about a yard [92 cm] off 
the ground and sit there; you cannot move in any direction, just back down" (p.158). 
Danaos excitedly asked for a demonstration, so Chang 
sat down on the floor, crossing his legs in a full lotus. He became still; 
it appeared that his breathing stopped. He was a statue of an Eastern 
mystic for a time. Smoothly and suddenly, almost matter-of-factly, he 
rose from the floor at least eight inches [20 cm], and remained there. 
My breath caught in my throat; after half a minute or so, John came 
back down. "The carpet is synthetic," he said, standing up, "otherwise I 
would have risen much more." (Danaos, 2000, p.158) 
Danaos did not inquire why Master Chang could only levitate straight up and down 
— unlike Joseph of Cupertino who sometimes flew seemingly purposeful 
trajectories— or why a synthetic carpet would inhibit his levitation, but what is 
relevant from the perspective of this research is that Danaos later describes Master 
Chang's ability to communicate with spirits while deep in meditation—the result of 
his advanced martial arts training. A friend of Chang's had recently moved into a 
house and had heard strange noises which he believed were from a spirit. As a 
neikung master, Chang was asked to come and investigate. Chang explained to 
Danaos (2002) that "Spirits are bound by space and time the same way as anything 
that exists, but on a different level because they are a part of the yin world. We 
ourselves are yang; they are yin" (p.51). Danaos quotes Chang's explanations of 
the distinction between yin and yang throughout his books; for example: 
Everything on earth is yang, though the earth is yin. We, as humans, 
are yang creatures, but we have yin energy as well. It is the 
combination of the two that gives us life. When we die, when we cease 
to have life, our awareness moves to the yin state of being.... But it 
does not remain unaltered in the process, (in Danaos, 2002, p.52) 
At the supposedly haunted house offerings for the spirit, such as incense, tea, 
cakes and a cigarette, had been put on a table. The room was only lit by candles 
because of the belief that the yang attributes of bright light might scare the spirit 
away. Master Chang entered a meditative state and repeated aloud the spirit's 


--- Page 48 ---

39 
answers to his questions. Some of the offerings started to move and the incense 
burner smashed on the floor because, as Chang explained, the spirit was an old 
Muslim man who did not like incense. When dialogue recommenced an agreement 
was made that the spirit would protect those in the house and receive weekly food 
offerings. When asked how the spirit was able to move objects on the offering 
table, Chang explained that, while he was deep in meditation, the spirit would "be 
able to take yang ch'i from me, and he will be able to move the objects" (in Danaos, 
2002, p.56). This is a more complex explanation for PK than is currently provided 
by Spiritualists or parapsychologists. If a meditating neikung master can provide 
yang chi to a spirit, who only has yin chi, the two energies combined may produce 
what appear to be psi phenomena. Whether this means that Master Chang 
levitated by getting yin chi from the ground to mix with his own yang chi, is not 
explained by Danaos. If that was happening, perhaps levitation can work in two 
ways. A person with enough yang energy may be able to levitate either by absorbing 
yin energy from the ground or by getting it from a cooperative spirit. Testing this 
theory might be difficult, but these alternatives match the two theories about 
poltergeist activity, where it is disputed whether unconscious personal PK energy or 
the energy of spirits is what levitates people and moves objects, or whether it could 
be a combination of the two. Master Chang's spiritual encounter suggests that, as 
a result of the deep meditation that is an integral part of their training, advanced 
qigong practitioners may develop a belief in spirits. For example, Danaos (2002) 
claims that during his years of qigong training with Master Chang he has "spoken 
with spirits and can testify to their reality" (p.3). 
Because beginners do not need to believe in spirits, martial arts instructors in 
Western countries may initially omit spiritual references that might alienate people 
who already have their own religious beliefs. An example of this emerged during my 
interview with qigong and tai chi instructor Maurice. In about 1985, Maurice was 
given verbal permission to use a Christian church hall for his classes. Later the 
priest asked what exactly the classes were about and was horrified to hear that it 
was tai chi. "Not tai chi in my church" he exclaimed, because, in his ignorance, he 
apparently believed that tai chi mingles the concepts of good and bad. Later 
Maurice received anonymous letters claiming that the devil was involved in his 
classes. During my interviews with qigong instructors (all of whom were male) I 
asked if they regarded qigong as a spiritual or religious activity. Most of them said 
that, although it had a spiritual component, qigong was definitely not a religion. 


--- Page 49 ---

40 
Jeremy insists that qigong "has no religious connotations. It is an exercise." 
William explains that "It's definitely not religious or spiritual, although it can incline 
a person towards that direction. It's a physiological method for controlling... the 
internal energy of the body." Maurice claims that qigong is "just a philosophy. It's 
not anything to do with religion," but he acknowledges that it is spiritual "because 
spiritual is part of the mind." John/who is involved in qigong healing, agrees; 
"Definitely a philosophy and spiritual, but nothing religious." Bradley acknowledges 
that "qigong is largely Taoist, but there's been a lot of Buddhist influence and even 
... yoga influences," so that today one "could even regard it as a physical practice." 
Bernard believes that qigong is spiritual because it "helps you get in touch with 
yourself," by which he means that by going deeper one can discover that one is part 
of a universal or "divine energy". Only Peter, an ordained Taoist monk, regards 
qigong as "both a philosophy and religious practice". As mentioned earlier, it seems 
that most of these Western instructors are inclined to secularise qigong. 
When asked whether they personally believed in spirits, some of the qigong 
teachers adopted a secular perspective, while others said yes. William believes that 
a ghost realm exists and accepts the traditional Chinese belief that "there are two 
energies; there's life and there's matter. We're life and we've been impregnated 
into matter." Jeremy insists that whatever a person's beliefs are about spirits, it has 
nothing to do with qigong. John says that people do have a soul or spirit which 
leaves the body at death, but would prefer to regard it as chi or energy. Bernard 
believes in spirits and a spirit realm, as does Peter who adds the Taoist perspective 
that "we all come from the aspect of universal consciousness, and ... we all return 
as part of universal consciousness. We return from whence we came." Bradley, 
too, has no doubt that humans have a soul or spirit that enters its own realm at 
death, but points out that "the whole point of Taoism is to become immortal," 
meaning that "the whole practice [of qigong] is about transforming your essence 
into your energy or spiritual body." John Blofeld's Taoism: The Quest for Immortality 
(1979) illustrates that those qigong practitioners who adopt a Taoist perspective 
are more likely to believe in spirits of the dead. Becoming a Taoist immortal does 
not refer to the physical body living forever. Dr Gillian Ross (1993) explains that the 
Taoist alchemical tradition "seemed to emphasize spiritual rather than physical 
immortality. The name of the game is to become one with the Tao and by 
implications, immortal" (p.180). Danaos regards Master Chang as an immortal 
because he can meditate deeply enough to communicate with spirits. A person who 


--- Page 50 ---

41 
can remain lucid at this level of meditation is supposedly capable of remaining 
conscious or 'alive' after the death of the physical body, and so becomes, in effect, 
immortal. Chang describes his astonishment when his dead master, Liao Sifu, first 
demonstrated his immortality by appearing in the flesh in the corner of his bedroom 
and then explained to Chang that "This is the speciality of our type of training, that 
after death you retain the characteristics and powers you had when you were alive. 
... You can take all youryangch'i with you" (in Danaos, 2000, p.44). Chang 
subsequently called on his dead master numerous times and found that although 
others could always hear his voice, only about ten percent of people could see him 
"in varying hues. I think you have to have a lot of yin ch'i to see a spirit plainly.... to 
some people he was transparent, to others as solid as you or I" (p.45). 
A belief in spirits and psi abilities is not essential for qigong practitioners, especially 
in the West. However, it appears that within many martial arts traditions there are a 
small number of people who develop psi abilities such as levitation, but only after 
meditating enough to access or accumulate sufficient chi, which they regard as a 
universal, spiritual energy that can facilitate psi events. Many of these advanced 
practitioners also believe in spirits and, like spirit mediums, may develop the 
capacity to communicate with them. This reveals several similarities between the 
other groups and qigong, but what distinguishes it from, for example, Spiritualism, is 
the precision of its training techniques and explanations, and the numerous uses to 
which qigong can be put. 
2.6 
Mysticism 
This section will focus primarily on the mysticism of Christianity, Buddhism, 
Hinduism and Islam because the majority of religious levitations involve mystics. 
The primary question is whether mystics, especially those that develop psi abilities 
such as human levitation, believe in spirits and spirit realms. It seems that most 
mystics, whatever their religion, are more interested in God or the Godhead than 
lesser spiritual beings, but it is nevertheless fundamental to their beliefs that a 
spiritual realm does exist. Most definitions of mysticism assume that all mystics are 
seeking the same outcome, although their techniques may vary. The problem with 
defining mysticism is that it is primarily an internal activity that often involves deep 
contemplation or meditation, so there is little for a witness to observe, unless 
perhaps the mystic is levitating. Evelyn Underbill (1915/n.d.), defines mysticism as 
"the art of union with Reality. The mystic is a person who has attained that union in 


--- Page 51 ---

42 
greater or less degree; or who aims at and believes in such attainment" (p.3). 
Guiley (1991) defines mysticism as "The belief in or pursuit of unification with the 
One or some other principle; the immediate consciousness of God; or the direct 
experience of religious truth" (p.387). She also believes that "Mysticism is nearly 
universal and unites most religions in the quest for the One" (p.387). Throughout 
history mystics have struggled to describe the extraordinary breakthrough states of 
consciousness that they experience as a result of their sustained interiorization. 
The Jesuit, Elmer O'Brien, provides a generic description of mystic experiences: 
1. The object encountered in mystic experience is thought by the 
mystic to be somehow ultimate. 
2. The manner of confrontation is immediate, direct. 
3. The confrontation is always different from the familiar exercise 
of either sense perception or of reasoning. (O'Brien, 1965, p. 14) 
As these definitions illustrate, some mystics use impersonal terms—such as 
Reality, the Absolute, the One, the Self, cosmic consciousness, or the Godhead — 
to describe what they have encountered, or they anthropomorphise and claim to 
have come face to face, or even merged, with God. For example, the modern mystic 
Andrew Harvey says that, "A mystic is someone who has direct cognition of God 
beyond thought and image. A mystic is one whose eyes have been opened through 
purification, discipline and grace to the living mystery and lives consciously in the 
divine presence" (Harvey & Matousek, 1994, p.21). As I have written previously, 
Mystics actively seek a deeper experience of the spiritual or divine 
essence within themselves. Paradoxically, this experience eventually 
transcends their individuality, and immerses them in a universal 
consciousness which they claim is the fundamental basis of reality. 
This spiritual breakthrough from duality to unity has been termed 
enlightenment, illumination, self-realisation, or a variety of other terms. 
(Harvey-Wilson, 1997, p.8) 
Hollenback (1996) explains that mysticism involves focusing one's attention 
inwards in the hope that eventually one can quieten the internal chatter that fills 
most people's minds. "When this mental background noise ceases... a dramatic 
change in the mystic's mode of consciousness takes place" (p.l). This change or 
mystical experience, he claims, is as different as normal consciousness is to 
dreaming. One could claim that, when entering an altered state of consciousness 
(ASC), the mystic — like a shaman or spirit medium — is accessing another 
dimension or realm inhabited by invisible spiritual entities. A different interpretation 
is that, by remaining motionless and stilling the mind, the mystic is attempting to 
trigger an internal mechanism that normally only operates at death, or during NDEs, 


--- Page 52 ---

43 
which ejects that person's soul or spirit out of the physical body into this spiritual 
otherworld. Whether one uses the term 'realm' or 'ASC', it appears that those who 
have had these experiences are more likely to develop psi abilities than those who 
have not. Ring (1992) found that 51.5% of people reporting UFO close encounters 
and 60.8% of near-death experiences claim an increase in psi abilities (p.277), 
which appears to be similar to shamans developing these abilities after their 
initiation journeys into the spirit realm. A survey of mystics would probably reveal 
similar results. 
Christianity. As members of a monotheistic religion that believes in life-after-
death, most Christians believe in a divine realm containing God, a hierarchy of 
spiritual beings such as archangels and angels and spirits of the dead. For the 
deceased to be canonised into sainthood in the Catholic Church there must be 
proof of several miracles resulting from believers praying for intercession. Whether 
the would-be saint is causing the miracle, or petitioning God for assistance, the 
point is that Christians believe that spirits from another realm are capable of 
facilitating psi events. However, as Kenneth Woodward (1991) points out, not all 
saints are mystics and not all mystics are saints (p.160). Within Catholicism there 
are many reports of human levitation, primarily by mystics or saints, although 
"Levitation cannot be put forward as one of the miracles required either for 
beatification or canonisation" (Thurston, 1952, p.31), so the nineteen saints in 
Brewer's A Dictionary of Miracles (1884/1966, p.215) who were "lifted up" were 
canonised for other reasons. 
Leroy (1928, pp.39-135) fills nine chapters discussing levitating Catholics. In his 
opinion "the case of St Joseph of Cupertino is a very strong one" (p.169). Born in 
1603 in Cupertino, Italy, Joseph was often seen levitating by many witnesses. 
During a visit to Rome he spontaneously levitated as he knelt to kiss the feet of 
Pope Urban VIII (Tutt, 1997, p.8) who was so impressed that he volunteered to 
testify to the reality of the event (p.8). Several researchers have studied the 
Franciscan friar (Bartman, 2003; Braude, 1986; Chambers, 1998; Cornwell, 1991; 
Dingwall, 1947/1962; Thurston, 1952). Leroy writes that, once while walking 
outdoors, a priest said to him "Brother Joseph, what a beautiful heaven God has 
made!" whereupon Joseph levitated up into an olive tree, 
And he remained on the tree half an hour, in kneeling posture, lightly 
poised on a branch that could be seen to wave to and fro as if a bird 


--- Page 53 ---

44 
had been perched on it. When he came to himself, he could not come 
down, and required a ladder to do it. (Leroy, 1928, p.92) 
Joseph was a mystic who was deeply devoted to Mary, and could only levitate while 
in a trance. Pastrovicchi (1918/1980) describes how Joseph "was often 
enraptured and lifted from the ground" on hearing the words 'Holy Mary', 'Holy 
Mother of God', 'Mother of Divine Grace', 'Mother of God', or 'Gate of Heaven' 
(p.52). Although he and those around him clearly believed that his levitations were 
a sign of divine grace, Chambers (1998) notes that Joseph appeared to have "no 
control over the timing and nature of his levitations" (p.166), and that he "never 
offered an explanation as to the nature of his levitations, describing them as fits of 
'giddiness'" (p.167). Joseph's levitations and lifestyle are well-documented; he 
fasted almost continuously; he had numerous other psi abilities; his levitations 
involved hovering as well as directed flight; at times he lifted others into the air; and 
the Church's ambivalence towards him is illustrated by the fact that he was called 
before the Inquisition while alive and made a saint after his death. 
Although Christian mystics such as Joseph believe in the existence of spiritual 
beings such as angels, they are more likely to attribute miraculous events to God or 
divine grace. The mystic St Teresa of Avila, who was seen levitating by many 
witnesses, refers to "our Lord" as the cause of her levitations (in Leroy, 1928, p.70). 
Teresa wrote about her levitations in her memoirs and, when in public, at times 
tried to resist them because, as the prioress of a convent, she "was afraid it would 
occasion much talk" (p.69). She writes that 
The moment that I felt that our Lord was about to repeat the act [of 
levitation], and once, in particular, during a sermon ... I threw myself on 
the ground; then the nuns came around to hold me; but still the rapture 
was observed. I made many supplications to our Lord, that he would be 
pleased to give me no more of those graces that were outwardly visible, 
(in Leroy, 1928, p.70) 
Thurston (1952) says that Teresa, "being perfectly conscious of the physical effect 
of levitation produced on many occasions by these raptures, persistently fought 
against all such exterior manifestations which betrayed her privileged condition as a 
friend of God and made her appear singular" (p.ll). One of St Teresa's most 
famous levitations happened while she was talking to St John of the Cross, who had 
come to her convent to visit her. They were speaking about the Trinity through a 
grate when "he was rapt in ecstasy and rose from the floor, lifting up his seat along 
with him into the air. St Teresa, who was kneeling, was also lifted up above the 
ground" (Leroy, 1928, p.71). As to what causes the levitation of saints and mystics,

Thurston (1952) explains that "Theologians for the most part offer the rough and 
ready solution that in the case of holy people it is a manifestation of divine power, 
effected perhaps through the ministry of angels" (p.30). Woodward (1991) quotes 
Father Sarno at the Vatican who points out that, while assessing the miraculous 
powers of potential saints, "We have to ask whether are they of divine origin, 
diabolical origin, or are they merely the effects of an emotionally disturbed person" 
(p.163). Although he is not just talking about levitation, Father Sarno seems to 
acknowledge that, as with poltergeist activity, psi events can be caused by both 
spiritual powers and the human mind. 
Hinduism. Unlike the other great world religions, Hinduism has no founder, no 
fixed dogma and is highly diverse. Hinduism venerates several ancient collections 
of writings such as the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad-Gita. As well as 
providing examples of levitating mystics, this section will focus on whether Hindus 
believe in a divine realm inhabited by spiritual beings who are responsible for psi 
abilities such as levitation. One has only to glance through Harshananda's Hindu 
Gods and Goddesses (1982) and A.G. Mitchell's book (1982/1992) of the same 
name to realise that Hinduism believes in a vast pantheon of divine beings, 
although, as Harshananda notes, "there can be as many spiritual paths as there are 
spiritual aspirants" so long as one does not forget "that these gods are the 
doorways leading to the one Godhead" (1982, p.xvii). The Indian mystic Sri 
Ramakrishna (1836-1886) describes the inner progress towards enlightenment: 
The more you advance towards God the less you will see of His glories 
and grandeur. The aspirant at first has a vision of the Goddess with ten 
arms; there is a great display of power in that image. The next vision is 
that of the Deity with two arms; there are no longer ten arms holding 
various weapons and missiles. Then the aspirant has a vision of 
Gopala, in which there is no trace of power. It is the form of a tender 
child. Beyond that there are other visions also. The aspirant then sees 
only Light, (in Gupta, 1974, p.110) 
Ramakrishna's description implies that all mystical pathways transcend mental 
concepts and visual imagery to access something universal that lies beyond them. 
Whether this includes transcending one's belief in spirits is not clear. Another view 
of mysticism is that one must learn to merge one's inner self with the omnipresent 
universal Self, although some point out that one's individual self has always been a 
part of the universal Self, but that the aspirant has been unconscious of that fact. 
The mystic Ramana Maharshi (1879-1950) explained to Paul Brunton that

When a man knows his true self for the first time something else arises 
from the depths of his being and takes possession of hnn. That 
something is behind the mind; it is infinite, divine, eternal. Some 
people call it the Kingdom of Heaven, others call it the soul and others 
again Nirvana, and Hindus call it Liberation; you may give it what name 
you wish. When this happens a man has not really lost himself; rather 
he has found himself, (in Osborne, 1954/1970, p.20) 
Although there are those who would question whether yoga should be classified 
with Hinduism, it is included here because most advanced yogis are 
indistinguishable from mystics. As Guiley (1991) points out, "In yoga one seeks to 
become bound to divine reality.... the search for the mystery of the universe is 
undertaken in a search for one's own true self" (p.657). As with qigong, one cannot 
claim that every Westerner attending yoga classes is seeking union with God or the 
Infinite, but this is because most beginners are doing Hatha yoga which involves 
physical exercises and postures called asanas. Unless they progress further and 
develop a deeper interest, they may be unaware that other branches of yoga exist, 
such as Raja yoga which is "the path of mind control through concentration, breath 
control, posture, meditation, and contemplation. Raja yoga is the most 
metaphysical of yogas" (Guiley, 1991, p.657). Yogananda's Autobiography of a 
Yogi (1946/1983) combines the mystical practices of yoga and Hinduism. After 
recounting how the yogi Bhaduri Mashasaya was seen levitating "in the air, several 
feet above the ground" (p.70) at a meeting of his followers in Calcutta, Yogananda 
explains that 
A yogi's body loses its grossness after use of certain pranayamas 
[breathing exercises]. Then it will levitate or hop around like a leaping 
frog. Even saints who do not practice a formal yoga have been known 
to levitate during a state of intense devotion to God. (Yogananda, 
1946/1983, p.71) 
Yogananda says that when miracles occur "The consciousness of a perfected yogi is 
effortlessly identified not with a narrow body but with the universal structure.... 
Gravitation ... is powerless to compel a master to exhibit the property of weight" 
(p.315). Although providing little practical information about levitation, Yogananda 
also writes that "He who knows himself as the omnipresent Spirit is subject no 
longer to the rigidities of a body in time and space" (p.315). As with the concept of 
chi and the collective term 'spirit' in Spiritualism, this explanation refers to a 
universal spiritual force that can produce psi events, rather than individual spirits. 
Mirroring Ramakrishna's earlier quotation, Yogananda says that the ultimate 
mystical experience is one of light: "A yogi who through perfect meditation has 


--- Page 56 ---

47 
merged his consciousness with the Creator perceives the cosmical essence as light 
... to him there is no difference between the light rays composing watsr and the light 
rays composing land" (p.315). Yogananda (1946/1983) claims that the spiritual 
essence of Hinduism, yoga and Christianity are similar: "The law of miracles is 
operable by any man who has realised that the essence of creation is light" (p.316). 
In Hinduism and Buddhism siddhis are psi abilities that may develop as a result of 
yogic or mystical practices. Although there are supposedly eight great siddhis, there 
are several other psi abilities experienced by mystics. Walker (1968) explains that 
the third siddhi is "laghima or weightlessness: the power that enables one to 
levitate and move about at extraordinary speed," and the fourth is "garima or 
weightfulness: the power of becoming 'even as heavy as a mountain, so that one 
cannot be moved'" (p.394). This sounds like excessive gravitation, which martial 
arts practitioners seek to develop, and which may occur involuntarily in spirit 
possession, but it is unclear whether it is levitation in reverse or an unrelated ability. 
Patanjali's Yoga-Sutras summarise yoga's philosophy and techniques. Taimini 
(1975) translates section three, sutra 40, as "By mastery over Udana levitation and 
non-contact with water, mire, thorns etc." (p.346). He explains that udana is one of 
the five forms of prana that exist within the body and "is obviously connected with 
the gravitational pull of the earth on the body and by controlling this particular 
prana it is possible to neutralise this pull" (p.346). Patanjali may have deliberately 
written his sutras cryptically so they would only make sense to advanced students, 
especially as psi abilities are often seen as spiritual distractions. The sutra and 
Taimini's (1975) explanation tell us little about levitation, other than acknowledging 
its existence, but originally "all students of yoga were made to commit it [the whole 
book] to memory and meditate regularly and deeply on the sutras for bringing out 
(sic) their hidden meanings" (p.ix). Spirits are not mentioned in the levitation sutra 
or Taimini's explanation, but a more detailed definition of prana is that it is a 
"cosmic energy that penetrates and maintains the body" and udana "works in the 
upper part of the body and furthers spiritual development by creating a bridge 
between the physical and spiritual aspects of one's nature" (Friedrichs, 1999, 
p.275). Prana sounds like chi, both of which can apparently be controlled by 
breathing exercises, as discussed in a later chapter. 
Idries Shah (1956/1973), a researcher and writer on Oriental philosophy and 
religion, believes that spirits are relevant to psi abilities: 


--- Page 57 ---

48 
Hindu occult science rests upon the belief that power over anything and 
everything on earth may be obtained by means of benign spirits.... 
such beings may be souls of the departed, or simply disembodied 
entities under whose supervision come the laws of nature. (Shah, 
1956/1973, p.141) 
He explains that "to interfere with the law of gravity, the spirit guarding that law 
must be invoked, and beseeched for help" (p.141). To investigate the matter, Shah 
"induced a Hindu magician of considerable importance to demonstrate certain 
tricks to me" (p.141). The man came to Shah's bungalow and, having checked that 
"there was no confederate or apparatus present" (p.141), Shah asked him to 
levitate one of the veranda chairs. The magician closed his eyes, extended his 
hands towards the largest chair on the veranda, and appeared to concentrate hard. 
In ten seconds "the chair seemed to rise into the air, and, turning slightly, actually 
hover in space, about five feet up [1.52 m]" (p.141). Shah grabbed the legs of the 
chair and pulled it down to the floor but, when he let it go, "it sailed upward again". 
Shah asked if he could sit on the chair: "Pulling it down again—the thing seemed 
to have a life of its own by now — I sat upon the seat and rose into the air on it" 
(Shah, 1956/1973, p.141). To check that he had not been hypnotised, Shah then 
asked the magician to levitate all the chairs on the veranda, which he did. Shah is 
not using the term 'magician' in the modern sense, and points out that such feats 
or "miracles" stem "from a mystical approach to wonder-working" (p.140). He does 
not, however, quote the Hindu magician's explanation for levitation. 
The French judge and traveller Louis Jacolliot (1884/1971) relates how in 1866 he 
befriended a Hindu fakir called Covindasamy, in the Indian holy city of Benares. On 
several occasions Covindasamy demonstrated his psi abilities and, when asked how 
he did them, replied, "It is not a natural force that acts. I am but an instrument. I 
evoke the ancestral spirits, and it is they who manifest their power" (p.230). 
Jacolliot had asked many fakirs the same question "and they have nearly all made 
the same answer. They look upon themselves only as intermediaries between this 
world and the invisible spirits" (p.230). The judge asked Covindasamy for a 
demonstration of "elevation". 
Taking an ironwood cane which I had brought from Ceylon, he leaned 
heavily upon it, resting his right hand upon the handle, with his eyes 
fixed upon the ground. He then proceeded to utter the appropriate 
incantations. ... the Fakir rose gradually about two feet [61 cm] from 
the ground. His legs were crossed beneath him, and he made no 
change in his position, which was very like that of those bronze statues 
of Buddha.... For more than twenty minutes I tried to see how 


--- Page 58 ---

Covindasamy could thus fly in the face and eyes of all the known laws 
of gravity; it was entirely beyond my comprehension; the stick gave him 
no visible support, and there was no apparent contact between that 
and his body except through his right hand. (Jacolliot, 1884/1971, 
P-237) 
There are several other levitation reports that involve sticks. If the levitator is not 
resting on it, surely the demonstration would be more convincing without the stick, 
unless it is essential for some reason. Using qigong theory, perhaps the stick is 
allowing yin chi to flow from the ground which, when mixed appropriately with the 
fakir's yang chi, enables levitation to that height to occur. A few days later, 
Covindasamy levitated to about half that height without a stick. Standing near a 
door, he crossed his arms and rose slowly "to the height of about ten to twelve 
inches [25-30 cm]" (p.257). He remained in the air for over eight minutes 
according to Jacolliot's chronometer and claimed he could levitate like that 
whenever he wished. To explain this ability, Covindasamy quotes the lines "He 
should be in constant communications with heaven, and a superior spirit should 
descend therefrom" (p.258). He may have needed less yin chi to levitate to this 
height or perhaps he obtained the yin chi from a spirit. 
Buddhism. Whether one regards Buddhism as a philosophy or a religion, it has 
produced numerous mystics and levitation reports and is increasingly popular in the 
West. Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama in the fifth century BCE and 
today has many sects and schools. Concentrating primarily on the Tantric 
Buddhism of Tibet, this section will demonstrate that Buddhist mystics believe in 
spiritual realms, entities and powers, some of whom can facilitate psi events such 
as levitation. Buddhism inherited much of its cosmology from Hinduism; for 
example, both believe in spiritual beings called devas, which some Buddhists 
regarded as gods or celestial beings that inhabit various heavenly realms as a result 
of their good deeds, but are.still subject to the cycle of rebirth. Blofeld (1974) 
explains that "To [Tibetan] Buddhists/the universe is alive with invisible beings, who 
in fact constitute four of the six orders of existence, the other two being men and 
animals" (p.72). Tibetans apparently "pay court to supernatural beings but only 
with a view to obtaining their protection or mundane favours" because "The gods 
have nothing to do with the search for enlightenment" (Blofeld, 1974, p.116). 
Fischer-Schreiber (1999a, p.86) writes that "There are in Buddhism twenty-eight ' 
divine realms, of which six are in the realm of desire... eighteen in the realm of 
desireless form ... and four in the realm of the bodiless". Edward Conze 


--- Page 59 ---

50 
(1959/1986) notes that in addition to heavens and hells, there are 'intermediary 
states' and "the 'Pure Lands' of the cosmic Buddhas" (p.221). He writes that 
"Buddhist theology knows of about thirty kinds of gods," although these "'gods' are 
in a way really 'angels' and their 'heavens' might also be called 'paradises'" (p.221). 
However, as Blofeld explains, 
The benign and nightmarish figures in the [Tibetan] sacred pictures, 
unlike gods and demons elsewhere, are recognised by the faithful as 
the products of their own minds, as symbolic representations of the 
phantasmagoria that haunts the threshold of human consciousness, 
and as the personifications of the forces of passion called into being by 
the everlasting play of mind. (Blofeld, 1974, p.38) 
Tantric Buddhists believe that some spiritual beings have an independent 
existence, while others are seen as entities "lurking on the threshold of the human 
consciousness whom C.G. Jung calls archetypes" (Blofeld, 1974, p.73). This 
suggests that the human mind and spirit realms form a continuum and, as with 
poltergeist activity, raises the question of whether psi events are caused by 
independent spirits, internal PK forces, or both. 
The goal of Buddhist or yogic techniques is to achieve enlightenment or Nirvana 
which, as Blofeld (1974) explains, is often described using analogies "deduced from 
the mystical perception that arises in meditation. The descriptions of it include 
radiant light, ecstatic bliss, infinity, wholeness, eternity, reality, shining void, the 
union of opposites, boundless compassion, immaculate undifferentiated mind and 
many, many more" (p.50). He notes that Buddhist, Christian and Sufi mystics may 
describe God in a similar manner because "Doubtless they have experienced the 
same reality" (p.50), but they may interpret their experiences differently. 
Buddhists do not equate this shining reality with a creator of the 
universe; they hold Nirvana to be not the presence of God, nor a 
heaven inhabited by individual souls, but a state of being beyond 
duality in which all beings are at one with one fenother and with Nirvana 
itself. (Blofeld, 1974, p.50) 
Blofeld points out that regarding Buddhism as a godless religion is an unfortunate 
interpretation because "Mystics of other religions who take the term 'God'to mean 
ultimate, divine reality—uncreated, sublime, omnipresent, immaculate, void of 
duality and the source of infinite compassion, but nevertheless impersonal —come 
very close to the Buddhist position" (p.52). Buddhist mystics, it seems, regard the 
ultimate level of spirituality as impersonal, although they are prepared to 
acknowledge the existence of invisible spiritual beings such as devas. Blofeld

(1974) explains that in Tantric mysticism "The forces at work in the universe are 
visualized in plural form because, in its non-void aspect, the universe is in fact 
plural" (p.116). This reveals that Buddhist mystics transcend the empirical 
argument as to whether spirits exist or not by defining reality as having different 
levels or realms which are linked by consciousness. 
Mackenzie (1999) provides an example of a Tibetan Buddhist's belief in spiritual 
beings. The English woman, Tenzin Palmo, spent many years meditating in the 
mountains of northern India. When a young shepherd boy started acting strangely 
near her cave, Palmo prayed to "her old friends" the local Dakinis, who are female 
Buddhist spiritual entities, asking them to "change his mind and help him" (p.91). A 
few days later the boy appeared transformed; he left her a bunch of flowers, fixed 
her spring and began smiling instead of scowling. The boy's transformation might 
have been coincidental, caused by spirits, or praying to the Dakinis may have been 
Palmo's way of indirectly affecting the boy with her own powers, because Buddhist 
mystics are traditionally advised not to use the psi abilities they may develop. 
Among the many psi abilities that may develop as a result of sustained Buddhist 
meditation, Conze(1959/1986) lists two "magical powers" (p.122) that sound like 
levitation. The first is described as, "He walks on water without sinking into it," and 
the second as, "Cross-legged he floats along like a bird on the wing" (p. 126). To 
walk on water, the Buddhist scriptures advise the practitioner to visualise it as a 
supporting "disk of clay", and to fly, an area of air big enough to sit, lie or walk on 
should be visualised as being composed of earth. Although this does not explain 
how levitation works, any meditator who tried it would probably need to have 
powerful visualization abilities. This technique suggests that some psi abilities may 
work more easily if packaged in a familiar manner. For example, it might help to 
levitate if one visualises walking up a flight of stairs. 
John Keel (1957) tells of meeting a Buddhist lama called Nyang-Pas who, though 
originally from Tibet, "now spent his life alone in the hills of Bhutan and Sikkim, 
searching for the 'right ways'" (p.185). Having heard of the lama's psi abilities, Keel 
asked him for a demonstration. From sitting cross-legged on the floor, the lama 
struggled to his feet, pressed one hand on the top of his stick, a heavy 
branch about four feet [1.22 m] long, frowned a little with effort, and 
then slowly lifted his legs up off the floor until he was sitting cross-
legged in the air! There was nothing behind him or under him. His sole 


--- Page 61 ---

52 
support was his stick, which he seemed to use to keep his balance. I 
was astounded. "Can you teach me this?" ! asked hopefully. "No... it 
is not something you can learn overnight. It is a matter of will." He 
conducted the rest of our conversation sitting there in empty space. 
(Keel, 1957, p.186) 
This example is similar to Jacolliot's description of the levitating Hindu fakir, 
Covindasamy, although the lama advocates will-power while the fakir puts the 
responsibility on spirits. Rather than attributing this to a difference between 
Hinduism and Buddhism, I suggest that it results from a difference in their religious 
cultural context. Jacolliot (1884/1971) explains that Covindasamy was in Benares 
to "take charge of the remains of a rich Malibar" from the merchant caste because, 
according to Hindu belief, "those who die in the Holy City are not obliged to go 
through any further transformations, but their souls immediately ascend to the 
abode of Brahma and are absorbed into the great soul" (p.229). If Covindasamy 
specialised in spirits of the dead, it is not surprising that he attributes his powers to 
them. It also illustrates the similarities between the seven groups; by attributing his 
levitations to spirits, Covindasamy is acting like a Spiritualist, and by presiding over 
ceremonies to assist the dead in the afterlife, he is acting like a psychopomp, which 
is one of the roles of a shaman. The lama Nyang-Pas does not comment on spirits 
in Keel's book, so it is not possible to compare his beliefs with Covindasamy's. 
While discussing beliefs in the origins of psi abilities, Hollenback notes that 
many of the Buddhist and Hindu practitioners of yoga ... claim that 
whenever a yogin beginsto manifest supernormal powers... he has 
acquired [them]... by means of his own efforts of mental discipline.... 
without the assistance of any god or spirit-being. Consequently, their 
soiritual powers had an intrapsychic origin, an origin inside the mind or 
psyche of the yogin. (Hollenback, 1996, p.356) 
Debating whether a mystic's psi abilities originate from within the mind or 
elsewhere suggests a poor understanding of mysticism. Considerable mental 
discipline is needed to become an advanced meditator, but if, by going inwards, a 
mystic has achieved an internal breakthrough to a transcendent, spiritual reality 
that facilitate psi abilities - as most shamans do during their initiation experiences 
— then the term 'within the mind' now means something quite different. An 
advanced or enlightened mystic's 'mind' has now become a gateway to powers that 
are beyond the individual mind. A mystic who involuntarily becomes the victim of 
these forces could be described as possessed, which will be discussed in the next 
chapter. Like shamans and Spiritualists, Tibetan Buddhist mystics believe in both 
spirits and a transcendent spiritual energy that can facilitate psi phenomena.

Islam. Sufis are the mystics of the Islamic religion. The aim of this section is to 
demonstrate that Islam acknowledges the existence of a spirit realm and spiritual 
entities, and that there are reports of Islamic or Sufi mystics levitating. "Sufi means 
awareness in life, awareness on a higher plane than on which we normally live" 
(Friedlander, 1975, p.15). Since its inception, Sufism has existed as various 
schools or lineages, one of the most famous being the Order of the Whirling 
Dervishes which was founded in the thirteenth century. 
The aim of the dervish is to open the eyes of the heart and see infinity 
in eternity. His goal is to loosen himself from the earth's glue which 
binds him and become one with God, to become a channel for His 
Light. (Friedlander, 1975, p.19) 
As with other types of mysticism, Sufis aim to transcend their individual egos and 
merge their consciousness with the divine. "The Sufi who sets out to seek God calls 
himself a 'traveller'... he advances by slow 'stages'... along a 'path'... to the goal of 
union with Reality" (Nicholson, 1914/1963, p.28). This may be achieved by 
"chanting, singing, group movement or dance/or more interior meditations" 
(Smoley & Kinney, 1999, p.241). However, as with Buddhist Bodhisattvas who, 
although spiritually enlightened, return to normal life to assist those less advanced 
than themselves, Sufism advocates "the ability to function unobtrusively in daily life 
while maintaining the ecstatic connection with the Infinite" (p.241). Hollenback 
(1996) prefers the term 'recollection' rather than concentration, contemplation or 
meditation to describe the technique used by mystics to focus their minds and 
emotions in order to subdue background mental chatter. "Once mystics stop this 
process of silently talking to themselves, they transform their mode of 
consciousness and begin to have their first tangible encounters with that spiritual 
world that otherwise remains imperceptible to the five senses" (p.95). In Islam a 
popular method of recollection is dhkir which involves ceaselessly repeating the 
name of Allah like a mantra so that it eventually permeates one's whole 
consciousness to the exclusion of everything else. "This technique ultimately leads 
the Sufi to an ecstatic contemplation of God" (Hollenback, 1996, p.102). Islam 
acknowledges the existence of a soul within everyone that can access the spiritual 
realm. The human being 
can rise to higher stages of perfection. His soul is different from his 
body. It is a spiritual substance created but not shaped. It is not bound 
by space and time but it is akin to the universal soul and just as the 
latter is a macrocosm, it is a microcosm of the universe. (Shushtery, 
1980, p.69) 


--- Page 63 ---

54 
Sufis believe that psi abilities such as walking on water (p.135), or being unharmed 
by fire (p. 193), frequently accompany this degree of spiritual development. Baraka 
(or baraqa) is the divine quality or blessing possessed by Sufi saints which "makes 
the performance of miracles, or karamat possible" (Charles & Jordan, 1995, p.113). 
Islam believes in invisible spiritual beings, one category of which is the jinn who, 
according to the Koran (Dawood, 1995, p.408), are an order of intelligent beings 
"positioned between angels and mankind" (Druffel, 1998, p.181). Earle Waugh 
(1972) writes that 
The roots of belief in jinn reach back into pre-lslamic times.... They 
were capable of having a genealogy, and could respond to the message 
of Muhammad; some were destined for paradise, and others were 
bound for hell. They had bodies formed of vapor or flame, as opposed 
to man's body of clay. (Waugh, 1972, p.154) 
Druffel (1998) explains that 'clay' means that "our bodies are composed from 
mineral chemical elements found on the earth, to which a spiritual essence called 
the spirit or the soul is joined during our earthly life" (p.183). Ufologist Gordon 
Creighton (1983) suggests that inter-dimensional entities such as the jinn may be 
responsible for some alien abductions. Druffel (1998) says that, while the Koran 
says that angels are made out of light, the jinn "are reportedly made of neither light 
nor clay, but of a substance variously translated from the Arabic as 'essential fire', 
'essential flame', 'smokeless fire', or 'smokeless flame'" (p.183). Waugh (1972) 
explains that the jinn are supposedly able to fly, and he provides examples of their 
"ability to transport other people" (p.155), thus demonstrating that Islamic 
mysticism believes in spiritual entities'who can levitate people. Leroy (1928, p.7) 
acknowledges that "the belief in the levitation of the ascetic is a well-established 
tradition" in Islamic mysticism. Both Leroy (p.7) and Charles and Jordan (1995, 
p. 128) provide the example of the thirteenth century Persian poet and mystic Jalalu 
d'Din Rumi levitating. Once, when playing with some other children on the roof of a 
house, he was asked if it were possible to jump to the next roof. Rumi replied that it 
would be better to leap towards heaven and, jumping into the air, vanished from 
view. When the other children began crying from fear, Rumi reappeared and 
explained that "he had been carried away by celestial beings, who had brought him 
back to earth" (Leroy, 1928, p.8). Waugh provides examples of flight or levitation 
which he claims are the product of magical power rather than religious power. In 
one example, a magician attempts to demonstrate his superior powers by flying 
high into the air on his deerskin magic carpet, whereupon, Khawaja Mucinu'din 


--- Page 64 ---

Chisti, a Sufi saint, sends his wooden clog into the air to beat the magician until he 
returns to the ground. Humiliated and defeated, the magician converts to Islam, 
thus possibly revealing the purpose of the story. In Waugh's (1972) opinion, this 
confrontation demonstrates that the Sufi saint had "control over even magical 
procedures in the name of God" (p.159). He explains that, according to popular 
belief, magical flight depends "upon the magical powers resident in man solely" 
(p.160), and that although "the ability to fly was not something qualitatively 
different than the religious ability" (p.161), its motives were not as well regarded as 
religious flight. As with poltergeist activity, Waugh's explanation that magic come 
from within and religious powers are external illustrates the confusion about the 
location of divine or personal PK power and reflects the apparent difference 
between a mystic who can levitate at will and someone who attributes it to external 
spiritual entities. Whether magical or divine, it is seems probable that levitation 
derives from a transcendent source that is connected to human consciousness, but 
takes considerable training to bring under voluntary control.

Chapter Summary 
This chapter has demonstrated that, to varying degrees, six of the groups that 
produce levitation reports—shamanism, poltergeist activity, Spiritualism, alien 
abductions, qigong practitioners and mystics — believe in the existence of a spirit 
realm or otherworld inhabited by various entities and powers that can facilitate psi 
events. Some groups focus on these beliefs more thanothers. For example, the 
typical martial arts student is probably more interested in learning how to access 
spiritual energies such as chi rather than communicating with spirits, but may 
develop such an interest if he or she becomes an advanced practitioner. 
The seventh section of this chapter would, somewhat redundantly, have explained 
that the phenomenon of spirit possession involves a belief in spirits, but, to avoid 
repetition, that information has been incorporated into the next chapter which 
documents that the theme of spirit possession runs through most of the seven 
groups. 
Returning to the first six groups, their descriptions of spiritual entities vary and none 
can empirically prove the reality of spirits, although that does not mean that they do 
not exist. Having noted that "The various genres of mystical literature... repeatedly 


--- Page 65 ---

56 
interweave descriptions of mystical states of consciousness with accounts of 
miraculous powers and events" (p.17), Hollenback (1996) asks "why it is that 
supernormal phenomena so often accompany mystical experiences?" (p.20). This 
research has expanded that question to ask why it is that psi phenomena such as 
human levitation are reported to accompany shamanism, mysticism, Spiritualism, 
spirit possession, poltergeist activity, alien abductions and qigong? Perhaps all 
these activities can be seen as types of mystical experience. The perspective that 
this chapter favours is that the groups that most often produce levitation reports 
involve people who, consciously or unconsciously, deliberately or involuntarily, 
interact with a spiritual or other-dimensional realm which, as mystics appear to 
believe, contains energies or beings whose powers can facilitate miraculous or psi 
phenomena. 
Although many within these groups believe that spirits cause psi events, some 
advanced practitioners seem to have trained themselves to levitate voluntarily, 
apparently without the assistance of spirits. Perhaps spirits will facilitate levitation 
until people have learnt how to do it themselves. The finding that some 
practitioners use impersonal terms such as energy or chi rather than referring to 
spirits raises the topic of personification or anthropomorphism and whether 
independent spirits actually exist. Beneficial psi events such as healing may be 
more likely to occur if one personifies whatever lies behind them because that helps 
focus one's attention, emotions and whatever psi abilities one may have. On the 
other hand, recalling that Spiritualists refer to 'spirit' as a universal spiritual power, 
and 'spirits' as individual entities, it could be misleading to assume that there is 
much difference between the concepts of spirits and spiritual energy. These might 
just be different perspectives of the same underlying phenomenon, as is illustrated 
by the two competing theories for poltergeist activity which put the responsibility on 
either spirits or unconscious PK energy from a living person. The suggestion that 
some aspect of the mind or consciousness survives death to become a spirit—as 
many of these groups believe—seems to imply that the major difference between 
the consciousness of a living person and the spirit of a dead one is that the former 
has a body and the latter does not. A more detailed reading of the beliefs of these 
groups suggests that the mind or consciousness of a normal living person has at 
least two levels; a personal one whose field of operation is limited to the confines of 
the body, and a universal or transpersonal level which can operate beyond the body, 


--- Page 66 ---

57 
but which generally lies dormant until death or unless that person undergoes 
enough meditative training to bring that level under conscious control. In the very 
few people who achieve this goal, human levitation appears to become a voluntary 
PK talent rather than being dependent on the whim of spirits. It seems, therefore, 
that an open or transpersonal model of the human mind is the best theory to 
resolve the internal-external conflict about the source of PK phenomena such as 
levitation.

Chapter 3 
Spirit Possession 
This chapter demonstrates that, in various forms, the theme of spirit possession is 
found in the seven selected groups, with the exception of qigong where few 
examples are seen. The previous chapter explains that these groups believe in 
spiritual realms containing entities who can not only communicate with people such 
as shamans and spirit mediums, but who can also cause psi phenomena such as 
levitation. Alternatively, some members believe that psi events are facilitated by a 
universal spiritual energy that flows through the consciousness of gifted or trained 
individuals. This raises the questions of whether consciousness is connected to a 
transpersonal realm inhabited by spiritual entities with psi powers, or whether 
spirits are personified artefacts of the mind that seem independent, or whether 
both ideas have some validity. Although this investigation does not seek to prove 
these theories, they are clearly relevant to the hypothesis-generating exercise of 
what causes human levitation. A spirit realm inhabited by independent entities may 
exist, but may also be accessible to some aspect of consciousness which is capable 
of generating spirits or tapping into their power. Both the transpersonal dimension 
of the human mind and independent spirits may therefore be capable of causing 
levitation. This chapter's theme of spirit possession is an extension of the 
discussion as to whether spirits or the mind can cause psi events. There exist 
several reports of people —called demoniacs within the Christian tradition, the 
source of many of this chapter's examples — who have levitated while supposedly 
possessed by spiritual entities. On the other hand, many modern researchers — 
some of whom deny that psi events occur during possession — assert that 
possession is caused by the unconscious mind. This chapter will briefly discuss 
these conflicting theories, as well as providing examples of levitation during various 
forms of spirit possession. The initial focus is on the concept of spirit possession 
within Christianity, followed by forms of possession within shamanism, poltergeist 
activity, Spiritualism, alien abductions, martial arts and mysticism. 
It is only for convenience that people who experience spirit possession are referred 
to as a group. In a religious context, possession is rare and controversial, and those 
who experience it cannot be defined as a group in the same sense as, for example, 
shamans, alien abductees, or Spiritualists. While they may share religious beliefs, it 
is unlikely that people who have experienced possession would meet for any 


--- Page 68 ---

59 
purpose. Definitions of spirit possession vary and within, for example, the Christian 
tradition, such people are generally regarded as involuntary victims of an 
unfortunate experience. There are also cases where spirit possession and 
poltergeist activity appear to overlap. Vincent Crapanzano broadly defines spirit 
possession as 
any altered or unusual state of consciousness and allied behaviour that 
is indigenously understood in terms of the influence of an alien spirit, 
demon, or deity. The possessed act as though another personality—a 
spirit orsoul—• has entered their body and taken control. Dramatic 
changes in their physiognomy, voice, and manner usually occur. Their 
behaviour often is grotesque and blasphemous. (Crapanzano, 1987, 
p.12) 
It is ironic that this definition uses the term 'alien' spirit because, although 
Crapanzano would probably define the word as meaning 'foreign', in recent years 
some people have suggested that alien abductions are a form of spirit possession. 
Klimo (1991, p.182) defines possession as a phenomenon "in which lower astral 
spirits are said to infiltrate the physical/emotional/mental system of a human 
being. Their aim is to gain control of a human nervous system so that they can 
resume some form of physical existence". In New Age parlance the astral realm 
refers to a spirit realm that interpenetrates physical reality and which may be 
accessed during out-of-body experiences (OBEs). Guiley (1989, p.324) makes a 
distinction between demonic and spirit possession. "Unlike demonic possession, in 
which a person is taken over by devils or evil spirits for harm, spirit possession is a 
voluntary, culturally sanctioned displacement of personality". However, it is almost 
impossible to distinguish clearly between good and bad spirits. The spectrum of 
opinions about interacting with, or receiving information from, psi sources ranges 
from the assertion that these are mental disorders through to the religious belief 
that, unless they are divinely inspired, they are the work of demonic spiritual 
entities. Some psychologists, especially those adopting a Jungian perspective, have 
concluded that, because psychological evidence has demonstrated that the mind 
can sometimes split into different personalities, people such as spirit mediums, 
shamans, abductees, religious ecstatics and demoniacs are actually talking to 
another part of themselves rather than independent spiritual entities. As Klimo 
(1991, p.182) writes, "part of the person's own mind splits off and then seems to 
turn around and possess him or her". Although this may occur occasionally, 
researchers who assert that it is true in all cases appear to be ignoring psi evidence 
that does not seem to fit their theories. 


--- Page 69 ---

60 
Oesterreich's (1921/1966) study of possession epitomises this scepticism. In his 
Introduction, Anita Gregory explains that Oesterreich believes that possession 
is really one and the same person masquerading at times... as a devil 
and talking to himself, and that it is part of the pathological process for 
the sufferer to be deluded as to the identity of the second person, (in 
Oesterreich, 1921/1966, p.viii) 
Oesterreich avoids discussing psi events in the cases he reviews, although he does 
admit that some mediums seem to possess clairvoyant abilities. In his "Appendix 
on Parapsychology" he acknowledges that "accounts of parapsychic phenomena in 
possession are quite common" (p.382), but suggests that, in the absence of 
supporting scientific evidence, they may be the result of "inaccurate accounts," 
which is a weak justification for disregarding evidence that contradicts his 
preconceptions. Normally a lack of research into an anomalous phenomenon is an 
incentive to look at the matter more closely rather than ignoring it. Oesterreich 
does not mention the well-documented Frangoise Fontaine (see Leroy, 1928, p.13) 
possession case, probably because it involves several instances of levitation. Such 
biases still exist in modern works; for example, Pickering's (1998, p.199) dictionary 
of witchcraft does not mention Fontaine levitating. A similar approach is taken by 
Dr William Sargant (1976, p.234) who claims that all forms of possession are 
caused by the same physiological processes, but does not discuss the psi events 
that often accompany them. On the other hand, the psychologist Stan Gooch 
(1984, p.222) acknowledges the existence of psi phenomena, but concludes that 
although "incubi, succubi and poltergeists are real... these phenomena are aspects 
of the human mind, not independent supernatural entities". Gooch (1984, p.231) 
further claims that "religionists through the ages have assigned the matters under 
discussion to the activities of spirits, demons, devils, gods, angels and ghosts. This 
total error has effectively prevented any useful or meaningful investigation of the 
area in question". One problem with claiming that spirits are mental creations is 
that we do not have a clear understanding of where the boundaries of the mind lie. 
If consciousness can transcend the physical brain then surely the domains of 
mentally created and independent spirits would overlap each other, making it 
almost impossible to differentiate between them. 
A medical explanation for some possession cases is Tourette's syndrome, which is 
"a rare neurological disorder whose symptoms range from facial tics to astonishing 
verbal outbursts, from barks and screams to uncontrollable swearing" (Dash, 1997, 


--- Page 70 ---

61 
p.373). Tourette's sufferers often "feel that some invisible entity is dictating these 
bizarre patterns of behaviour" (p.373). This theory fails to explain psi events, and 
claiming that certain behaviours are sometimes caused by a neurological disorder 
does not exclude the possibility that spirits may have caused that disorder. 
A sociological approach to spirit possession is illustrated by the historian Darren 
Oldridge (2000) who claims that "both the possessed and their spiritual doctors 
were acting out socially determined roles" (p.114), and that "the experience of 
possession provided an occasion for relatively disempowered individuals to address 
their social betters from a position of lofty, if precarious authority" (p.119). Oldridge 
believes that those who were not faking their possession symptoms may have been 
suffering from ailments such as epilepsy (p.119). It is possible that some historical 
demoniacs were adopting a social role that permitted them to "speak the 
unspeakable" (p.120), but Oldridge neglects to explain the psi symptoms that are 
occasionally reported to accompany the possession syndrome, which suggests that 
his interpretation of at least some cases is inadequate. A more balanced approach 
is adopted by the sociologist-anthropologist Michael Cuneo (2002), who claims to 
have witnessed more than fifty exorcisms and acknowledges that, although he did 
not see any psi phenomena, he cannot prove that demons do not exist (p.329). He 
asserts that modern exorcisms have a powerful placebo effect, and that for many 
people "it's simply a cop-out or a means of self-glamorization. They want to avoid 
responsibility for their own shortcomings by blaming them on demons" (p.334). It is 
understandable that many researchers claim that possession symptoms are 
produced by the mind rather than by spiritual entities. Science has shown that the 
mind can suffer from various illnesses, illusions and social pressures, whereas the 
existence of spirits is generally regarded as unproven, but researchers who ignore 
the psi aspects of possession cases appear to be adopting an incomplete 
explanation for the workings of human consciousness. 
The traditional Christian perspective on spirit possession is exemplified by Gabriele 
Amorth (1999) who has worked for many years as the chief exorcist in Rome and is 
the honorary President of the International Association of Exorcists. Amorth's 
writing is emotional and unscholarly, but the apparent popularity of his book 
suggests that it reflect the beliefs of many Catholics. Although he admits that the 
Church's "Ritual confines the use of exorcisms only to instances of true possession" 
(p.35), Amorth describes examples of possession where the symptoms seem to be 


--- Page 71 ---

62 
little more than aches and pains or depression. He acknowledges that "in the most 
difficult cases we are faced with individuals who art afflicted both by evil influence 
and psychological disturbances" (p.47), thus requiring the assistance of a 
psychiatrist. Amorth (1999, p.169) claims that out of the thirty thousand people he 
has treated, only ninety-three were truly possessed. In some cases he notes a few 
psi symptoms, but does not mention any examples of levitation, although in one 
case he describes a possessed girl who, when put on a table, "would twist and turn 
and fall to the ground, but at the last moment, before hitting the floor, she slowed 
down, as though a hand was holding her up, and would never hurt herself" (p.74). 
The Anna Ecklund case illustrates that levitation does occur in some instances of 
possession. Ecklund was born in America in around 1882 and first began to show 
symptoms of possession when she was fourteen. She was exorcised in 1912, but 
later become possessed again after her father supposedly cursed her (Guiley, 
1989, p.110). In 1928 another exorcism was attempted and as the ritual began, 
Ecklund, who was being held down on the bed by several nuns, broke free and flew 
through the air to the wall high above the doorway (Nicola, 1974, p.127; Wilson, 
1994, p.353). "She stuck there as if glued and finally had to be wrenched down" 
(Rogo, 1991, p.44). The exorcism lasted 23 days during which time Ecklund 
displayed numerous other symptoms, including excessive gravitation. 
In a second example, both Leroy (1928, p.17) and Rogo (1991, p.46) quote from a 
report to his superiors in France by a Christian missionary who had travelled to 
Indochina in 1738 and seemed prepared to experiment with levitation. 
While engaged in my exorcism, I suddenly had the idea to ask the Devil 
in Latin to move the possessed to the ceiling of the church. 
Specifically, this was to be done with feet upwards and head pointing 
down. Immediately the body became rigid, and the possessed was 
unable to use his limbs. He was propelled to a pillar in the middle of 
the church and, with his feet close together, pushed with his back 
toward the pillar. All this occurred while his hands remained out of use. 
He was transported to the ceiling, much like a weight that is forcibly 
pulled upward. Throughout all this, the man remained seemingly 
passive. He hung from the ceiling, his feet flat up against it, his head 
downwards.... I kept him, in this manner, up in the air for more than 
half an hour, but I did not have the persistence to leave him there any 
longer. I was, in any event, very frightened by what I had observed. I 
ordered the Devil to put the possessed back on his feet without any 
damage whatever.... He immediately tossed him down, like a package 
of laundry, completely unharmed, (in Rogo, 1991, p.46) 


--- Page 72 ---

63 
In religious cases such as these there appears to be little effort to deny that psi 
phenomena such as levitation do occur, although this may be because Christian 
authorities wish their followers to be fearful of demonic forces. Although the Church 
acknowledges that psychological causes need to be eliminated before exorcism is 
attempted, it adopts an unscientific and fearful approach to possession by 
dogmatically asserting that demonic entities are responsible without providing any 
conclusive empirical evidence or considering other possibilities. No convincing 
reason is provided to explain why some people become possessed and not others. 
For example, during his interview, the Catholic pastor Philip claims that "God 
permits Satan to possess certain people" probably because "people open 
themselves to it firstly by rejecting God, and secondly by pursuing a pathway that 
will lead towards more and more evil practices". However, if a child becomes 
possessed, Philip believes that 
there's no possible way that such a child can deserve demonic 
possession.... They're the example of an innocent person being 
possessed.... But God has permitted that to happen ... perhaps... so 
that people in the area can see how evil works or how evil is, so that 
people... can see the work of the exorcist in getting rid of that. 
The New Catholic Encyclopaedia (Aumann, 2003) adopts a slightly more open-
minded approach by admitting that some levitations may be caused by a natural 
force: "The three possible causes of levitations are God (directly or through the 
agency of angels), the devil (with God's permission), or some force or power of 
nature as yet unknown". A more rational approach would be to suspend judgement 
until further research is done, such as investigating any behavioural or 
psychological similarities between Christian demoniacs, because it is possible that 
all levitations are caused by a natural PK force. 
The psychologist Marc Cramer (1979, p.ll) offers what he describes as a new 
interpretation of spirit possession. Adopting a largely Jungian approach, he defines 
"demoniacal possession as an unconscious and parapsychological phenomenon of 
extraordinary intensity which may be understood as a universal, timeless 
phenomenon directly related to the balance of psychological forces and tensions in 
collective, transpersonal psyche" (p.ll). Cramer claims that "clerical explanations 
of possession phenomena are only credible if one already accepts the unprovable 
teachings upon which they are based" (p.10). In his opinion, claiming that 
possession is caused by demons or evil spirits "explains nothing since it merely 


--- Page 73 ---

64 
substitutes one ambiguity for another" (p.10). He asks what demons or spirits are 
and how and why they would want to take over a person's body. He asserts that 
the overwhelming majority of cases brought before the exorcist, 
anthropologist, mental science researcher or shaman are either 
hysterias, psychotic manifestations or outright frauds. Genuine cases 
of archetypal possession are exceedingly rare and may be mimicked by 
the many pseudo-possessions upon which most psychiatrists base their 
knowledge.... My position is that the possession syndrome... stands 
apart from possession-like hysterias, religious delusions and 
mythomania as a separate and unique variety of mental disorder which 
belongs in a category of its own and is not directly related to other 
forms of psychopathology as it is currently understood. (Cra mer, 1979, 
p.12) 
To help distinguish genuine instances of the possession syndrome, Cramer explains 
that the symptoms must satisfy behavioural, physiological and paranormal criteria 
(p.21). Cases that lack psi symptoms are, in his opinion, not genuine. "Classical 
demoniacal possession, albeit exceedingly rare, is both a psychopathological and a 
parapsychological phenomenon of extraordinary, if not unique, intensity" (p.253). 
However, while acknowledging that human levitation may be possible, Cramer 
asserts that there is "no acceptable evidence" to support the contention that any 
cases of (evilation have ever occurred during spirit possession (p.29). In what 
seems to be an illogical distinction, Cramer is prepared to accept reports of other 
psi events during possession cases but not levitation. 
In an apparent attempt to prove his point, Cramer claims thatreports of the 
possessed young Bantu girl, Germana Cele, who is said to have levitated on several 
occasions in Natal, Africa, in 1907, are unreliable. The case is described in several 
books. Rogo (1991) reports that her possession supposedly started after her first 
communion. Visitors and residents of the mission were amazed at her capacity to 
levitate. She was seen levitating in church by members of the congregation who 
attempted unsuccessfully to pull her down by the feet (p.45). "On one occasion the 
girl levitated six feet [1.83 m] over her bed during the reading of the rituals and 
then challenged the exorcist to join her!" (p.45). If sprinkled with holy water while 
levitating she would resume her position on the bed (Rogo, 1991, p.45). 
Sometimes she levitated vertically and sometimes horizontally, but it was observed 
that her clothing would cling to her body rather than hanging down as expected 
(p.45). Rogo (1991) and Gordon (1996) acknowledge that they obtained details of 
the case from Adolf Rodewyk's book Possessed by Satan (1975). •Cramer claims 
that Leon Cristiani (1974) is the source of much of the information about this case, 


--- Page 74 ---

65 
but that he got the data from an earlier book by Frangois Gaquere who "drew his 
information from secondary sources" (p.243), whom Cramer does not name. 
Cramer claims that a more reliable source is the Jesuit C.M. de Heredra (1922) 
whose book contains a lengthy quotation (p.114) from Delalle, the then vicar-
apostolic of Natal, who conducted the girl's final exorcism. For several months 
Delalle had received reports of two possessed girls on the St Michael's mission. He 
eventually gave permission for the priest in charge to exorcise the girls, but their 
possession symptoms recommenced. Delalle then travelled to the mission and 
questioned the priests and sisters. They reported that the sixteen-year-old girls 
could carry enormous weights, sometimes spoke Latin, seemed to be telepathic and 
that a few days previously Germana's dress and bed had spontaneously burst into 
flames. In addition, they reported that "sometimes they [the girls] are lifted off the 
ground in spite of the Sisters holding them" (in Heredra, 1922, p.116). Satisfied 
that she was possessed, Delalle began to exorcise Germana. 
Cramer (1979, p.244) claims that being "lifted off the ground" does not refer to 
levitation but to "hypermotor activity during the girls' fits" and concludes that, 
because Delalle himself does not mention seeing Germana levitate, reports in other 
books that she levitated must be incorrect. In his determination to show that 
levitation does not occur during spirit possession Cramer reveals a certain lack of 
logic. The failure of Delalle's report to mention Germana levitating does not prove 
that she did not, nor does it discredit reports that do mention her levitating. The 
sisters' reference to 'lifting off the ground' might well refer to levitation. Delalle was 
only at the mission for a short time, and Cramer is ignoring the possibility that many 
of the people there — priests, sisters, mission residents and visitors — during the 
several months that she was supposedly possessed and also during her first 
exorcism, may have seen her levitate and given evidence to that effect. Cramer's 
credibility about levitation reports is further challenged by the fact that while 
disputing the accuracy of Cristiani's reference to Germana levitating, he neglects to 
mention that Cristiani's book (1974) contains several other well-documented cases 
of levitating demoniacs. 
Other literary evidence also contradicts Cramer's claim that levitation is never a 
feature of the possession syndrome. A well-documented historical case is that of 
Frangoise Fontaine from Louviers in France, who was exorcised in 1591. The 


--- Page 75 ---

66 
official report of the case was found in the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris (Leroy, 
1928, p.13), because the levitation occurred in a courthouse "in the presence of 
Provost Morel, his clerk and other persons" (p.13). In the courtroom, Fontaine was 
seen to levitate about two feet [61 cm] into the air and then fall backwards before 
being dragged head-first along the ground by an invisible force. As the Provost 
started reading aloud the Gospel of St John, the possessed girl, "who was stretched 
on her back on the floor, was raised three or four feet [0.9-1.2 m] above the ground, 
and thus carried horizontally towards the extempore exorcist, who was so horrified 
that he fled incontinently into his office" (Leroy, 1928, p.14). Still floating on her 
back, Fontaine followed the Provost and his staff up the corridor to their office 
where the soles of her feet banged against their locked door. According to other 
witnesses, she then floated headfirst back through the courtroom and into the 
passageway causing "the gaoler, his servants, our archers and many prisoners who 
were present with several inhabitants of Louviers" to flee either into the prison or 
into the street, locking the girl inside (p.14). Fontaine's levitations did not end 
there. In church, as the cure Pellet attempted to give her the Sacrament, she 
levitated and was pulled to the ground by several people who grabbed her dress. At 
the third attempt to give her Communion, and also when they tried to shave her 
head, she levitated "high into the air with her head downwards and her feet 
upwards, without her clothes being upset" (pp.15-16). Leroy (1928, p.13) quotes 
other examples of demoniacs levitating with their feet upwards, whose clothes did 
not hang down. As with the Bantu girl in Natal, one can ask why an apparently evil 
possessing entity would maintain a demoniac's modesty while upside-down. 
It is possible, as Cramer (1979) suggests, that all reports of levitation during spirit 
possession are fictitious or exaggerated, but the detailed evidence and numerous 
witnesses suggest that he is wrong. Cramer is challenging historical and scientific 
prejudices by acknowledging that psi events are a part of the possession syndrome. 
For example, he claims that "there is no real mention of psi, or even of its 
possibility, in any anthropological study of possession I have ever read" (1979, 
p.224). However, by asserting that spirits and levitation are not involved in 
possession cases, Cramer is being almost as prejudiced as those he criticises. This 
may be to avoid alienating his psychology peers, because mainstream science -
including many parapsychologists - still regards macro-PK phenomena such as 
levitation as highly dubious.

3.1 Shamanism 
The purpose of this section is to show that spirit possession is an integral part of 
shamanism, although in indigenous societies it is viewed in a more positive light 
than in Christianity. Anthropologists have categorised spirit possession in a number 
of ways. I.M. Lewis defines spirit possession as 
an invasion of the individual by a spirit. It is not for us to judge who is 
and who is not really 'possessed'. If someone is, in his own cultural 
milieu, generally considered to be in a state of spirit possession, then 
he (or she) is possessed. (Lewis, 1971, p.46) 
Lewis (1971) refers to 'central' possession, which an indigenous society may value 
because it supports local cultural values, and 'peripheral' possession, which may be 
seen as undesirable because it does not. Crapanzano (1987, p.12) adopts 
anthropologist Raymond Firth's three categories which are 'spirit possession', 'spirit 
mediumship' and 'shamanism'. Spirit possession is defined as "phenomena of 
abnormal behaviour which are interpreted by other members of the society as 
evidence that a spirit is controlling the person's actions and probably inhabiting his 
body". Spirit mediumship involves the "use of such behaviour by members of the 
society as a means of communication with what they understand to be entities in 
the spirit world," and shamanism refers "to those phenomena where a person, 
either a spirit medium or not, is regarded as controlling spirits, exercising his 
mastery over them in a socially recognised way" (Firth, 1967, p.296). These 
categories demonstrate that interacting with spirits is central to shamanism 
because, unlike the Christian approach, the psi powers such as healing and 
clairvoyance that spirits appear to bestow on shamans are a valued resource in 
indigenous societies. 
In a traditional shamanic initiation experience, whether sought after or unforeseen, 
neophytes may find that initially they have little or no control over what is happening 
to them, which might lead some to describe these as possession experiences. As 
Vitebsky (1995) explains, "Shamanic power depends on keeping control over the 
trance state" (p.22). The difference between an inappropriate possession state and 
that of the typical shaman appears to be whether the spirits or the person in the 
trance is in charge. Shamans' initiation experiences teach them to gain access to 
the spirit realm at will so that later they can summon spirit helpers to assist them in 
various tasks. But some spirits are more powerful than others and it is not possible 
for every shaman to be in complete control all the time. Vitebsky (1995, p.148)

writes that sometimes "the shaman's degree of control appears only partial, as the 
relation with spirits is a tempestuous and stressful one". Joan Halifax explains that 
The relationship of the shaman with the spirit realm is complex and 
varied. In some cultures, one class of spirit is regarded as evil, another 
class is believed to be helpful. In other cultures, the spirits that 
dismember the shaman ultimately become allies. Some spirits tutor; 
others obstruct. The acquisition of spirits for most shamans is 
essential to the effective practice of this art. Spirits can possess the 
shaman or sing, as ally, in the near proximity. (Halifax, 1982, p.74) 
To explain the delicate balance between being involuntarily or voluntarily possessed 
by spirits, Eliade comments that 
It will easily be seen wherein a shaman differs from a 'possessed' 
person, for example; the shaman controls his 'spirits', in the sense that 
he, a human being, is able to communicate with the dead, 'demons', 
and 'nature spirits', without thereby becoming their instrument. To be 
sure, shamans are sometimes found to be 'possessed', but these are 
exceptional cases for which there is a particular explanation. (Eliade, 
1951/1989, p.6) 
Eliade discriminates between the types of spirit that shamans may encounter. 
We must distinguish carefully between familiar spirits proper and 
another more powerful category of spirits known as tutelary spirits; so 
too, a distinction must be made between these last and the divine or 
semidivine beings whom the shamans summon up during seances. A 
shaman is a man who has immediate, concrete experience with gods 
and spirits; he sees them face to face, he talks with them, prays to 
them, implores them — but he does not 'control' more than a limited 
number of them. (Eliade, 1951/1989, p.88) 
Sometimes a shaman may conduct a seance where spirits are invited to reveal their 
presence. The resulting psi events may be reminiscent of poltergeist activity or 
spirit possession. Kalweit (1992) recounts how in 1879 the explorer Sir Cecil 
Denny visited a Blackfoot camp in Alberta. With a translator, Denny entered the 
tent of the medicine man, who ignored them and continued smoking his pipe. After 
a while the tepee started shaking and lifting, so Denny went outside, only to find 
that there was no one there. When he returned, the tepee "began to move even 
more wildly, rocking back and forth, and it rose several feet off the ground, so that it 
was possible to see outside. The two men were overcome by fear, but their host did 
not budge" (p.156). The difference between these events and the paranormal 
chaos that so often occurs in poltergeist or possession cases is that the shaman 
can deliberately invite spirits to manifest their powers and can generally stop them 
at will. As Hamer writes 


--- Page 78 ---

69 
The main difference between an ordinary person and a shaman with 
regard to their guardian spirits is that the shaman uses his guardian 
spirits actively when in an altsred state of consciousness. The shaman 
frequently sees and consults with his guardian spirit, travels with it on 
the shamanic journey, has it help him, and uses it to help others to 
recover from illness and injury. (Harner, 1990, p.43) 
Kalweit (1992, p.155) reports how in eastern Greenland the angakoks (shamans) 
traditionally hold their seances in igloos. They are tied up with their drums next to 
them, and the spectators sit around on the sleeping ledges. The arrival of the 
spirits may be heralded by the drum appearing to play itself. 
The spirit enters the angakok.... He feels that he is sinking into the 
earth. From this moment on, either the spirit speaks through the 
mouth of the shaman or the shaman himself speaks. That is to say, 
there is only one soul at a time in his body. (Kalweit, 1992, p.155) 
These examples illustrate that shamans are capable of using their consciousness or 
will-power to harness, direct, or cease what appears to be the psi power of spirits; 
like Spiritualists they may even let the spirits speak through them, whereas the 
typical Christian demoniac seems to be involuntarily possessed by spiritual entities 
and cannot control them. This shows how differently spirits and psi powers can be 
viewed. Shamanism values and encourages such interactions, whereas the 
traditional Christian approach is to avoid or demonise them. 
3.2 Poltergeist Activity 
Because poltergeist researcher William Roll (1976, p.ll) believes that ESP and PK 
reports suggest that "the human self extends into the environment in ways that 
have not so far been brought out by science," he regards poltergeist phenomena as 
"not about spirits, demons, or ghosts but about human personality". There are 
others, however, who believe that spirits are sometimes involved in poltergeist 
activity. Gauld and Cornell (1979, p.227) discovered that out of the 500 poltergeist 
cases that they studied only 3% involved possession or obsession. Exorcism 
worked in 7% of the 500 cases, it failed in 3% and was "transiently successful" in 
2% (p.228). What happened in the remaining 88% of cases is not explained, but 
one might speculate that exorcism was not considered, perhaps because no one 
seemed to be possessed or was clearly identified as the focus of the activity. 
Cramer (1979, p.244) says that occasionally it is hard to differentiate between spirit 
possession and poltergeist activity because in some cases the syndromes appear to 


--- Page 79 ---

70 
overlap. Rogo (1990) concludes that the major difference between poltergeist 
cases and poltergeist-possession cases is that genuinely possessed people often 
display two symptoms not found in poltergeist cases: "(1) the ability to speak or 
understand languages never previously studied and (2) frequent levitations" 
(p.221). Rogo also suggests that if poltergeist symptoms break out first, it is 
possible that, as a result of their religious beliefs, the victims then convince 
themselves that they are possessed (p.219). Owen (1964, p.216) asserts that 
"among good poltergeist cases there are practically no instances of clear-cut 
levitation" but acknowledges that people may sometimes be thrown, pushed, or 
pulled, which he refers to as "traction of the human body" (p.194). Regardless of 
what one calls it, the evidence reveals that people are occasionally lifted into the air 
by an invisible force when in the grip of either syndrome/but more frequently in 
possession cases, and there is an ongoing dispute as to whether these psi events 
are caused by spirits, human consciousness, or both. 
The case of Theobold, aged nine, and Joseph Burner, aged seven, from lllfurth in 
Alsace, France, contains symptoms of poltergeist activity and possession. The boys 
first began displaying strange behaviour in 1865, but did not undergo allegedly 
successful exorcisms until 1869. During that time, numerous witnesses observed 
possession symptoms, such as their bodies being bent backwards, vomiting 
quant'ties of foul material and entangling their legs so tightly they could not be 
separated (Guiley, 1989, p.39). Their bed would sometimes rise into the air while 
they were in it and "Sometimes their mother, seated on the bed while it rose off the 
floor, would be thrown into the corner" (p.39). Poltergeist-like symptoms that 
occurred were that their room would get unnaturally hot, the furniture and curtains 
would move around, the windows would fly open and the house would shake (p.39). 
At Theobold's final exorcism, before several witnesses, 
The armchair, with the boy on it, was seen to rise into the air although 
three strong men struggled to keep it on the floor. The child foamed at 
the mouth and screamed in a violent rage as the men who attempted 
to control him and the levitating chair were thrown and tossed from 
side to side. When the disturbances ceased and the chair returned to 
the ground the exorcisms began. (Cramer, 1979, p.245) 
Although the Burner boys displayed many of the usual symptoms of spirit 
possession, Cramer contends (p.246) that being on a chair that rises into the air is 
symptomatic of poltergeist activity and therefore cannot be called human levitation. 


--- Page 80 ---

71 
Without questioning Cramer's terminology, it seems likely that the same force 
levitates chairs, beds and people. 
Stuart Gordon (1996) reports a similar poltergeist-possession case of the thirteen-
year-old Lutheran boy called 'Roland Doe' which began in January 1949 in 
Georgetown, USA. Paintings rattled, objects vanished only to reappear elsewhere, 
furniture moved and strange knocking and scratching noises were heard in the 
house. Although initially symptomatic of poltergeist activity, the case worsened 
w'.jn the family rushed into his bedroom one night to find the screaming boy and 
his mattress suspended in mid-air (Gordon, 1996, p.182; Nicola, 1974, p.109). 
This recurred even when Roland was moved to other houses. "The boy suffered 
spasms, and bounced up and down on his bed as though controlled by puppet 
strings. Full levitations were interspersed with these unnatural events" (Rogo, 
1990, p.211). The exorcism took place in a Catholic hospital in St Louis. Gordon 
(1996, p.183) reports that, "Fighting his handlers with amazing strength, Roland ... 
read the exorcists' minds and understood the ritual Latin they spoke. In each 
session the room grew ice-cold; sometimes he levitated". A witness describes how 
One night the boy brushed off his handlers and soared through the air 
at Father Bowdern standing some distance from his bed [with] the 
ritual in his hands. Presumably, Father was about to be attacked but 
the boy got no further than the book. And when his hand hit that... he 
didn't tear the book, he dissolved it. The book vaporized into confetti 
and fell in small pieces to the floor, (in Erdman, 1975, p.55) 
Another example of poltergeist-possession is that of Helene Poirier (1834-1914), a 
laundress in the French parish of Coullons. Canon Champault, for whom she 
worked for many years, provides most of the evidence (in Cristiani, 1974, p.104). 
Poirier was possessed "at least twice over a period of six years, and in each case 
was exorcised" (p.105). For hours witnesses observed the curtains around her bed 
shaking and the curtain rings rattling backwards and forwards. She was thrown to 
the ground and suffered slaps, kicks and strangulation attempts by invisible forces 
that left marks all over her body for weeks. 
There were numerous instances of levitation: in each case Helene was 
seized by the hair, always by some invisible power, pulled around the 
room, lifted from the ground and finally thrown, in a half-strangled 
state, upon her bed. Once she was suddenly seized by the head and 
transported over the neighbouring houses, a distance of some forty-five 
yards [41 m]. (Cristiani, 1974, p.105) 


--- Page 81 ---

72 
With the Enfield poltergeist (Playfair, 1980) only a few of the symptoms seem like 
possession. Janet, the young girl at the centre of the case, was sometimes terrified, 
intrigued, or amused by the bizarre happenings in the house. For much of the time 
she continued to attend school; sometimes she lapsed into a violent trance and 
started to behave as if possessed (Playfair, 1980, p.103), but seemed to be cured 
when some Brazilian Spiritualists visited the house and commanded whatever was 
possessing her to leave (p.110). Another of Janet's possession symptoms is that a 
laryngograph experiment revealed that the audible voices of the spirits supposedly 
causing the poltergeist activity were generated within her throat (Playfair, 1980, 
p.228). Janet may have been deliberately or unconsciously faking the spirit voices, 
but Playfair believes that the Voice was genuinely speaking through her. He 
acknowledges that it is not possible to prove the matter either way, although the 
Voice was considerably deeper and had a completely different wave-form to Janet's 
normal voice. During traditional exorcisms, demonic entities are reported to speak 
through the possessed person's mouth in different voices. It was suggested to 
Playfair that Janet was an unconscious spirit medium who had not yet learnt to 
control her talent. This is reminiscent of both shamanism and Spiritualism, and 
may explain other poltergeist cases. 
The evidence reveals that in most poltergeist cases there are few overt symptoms 
of possession, but that sometimes they do develop. Given that the competing 
theories about spirit possession and poltergeist activity are the same — that they 
are caused by spirits, the unconscious mind or a mixture of the two — researchers in 
both fields are probably not surprised that the symptoms occasionally overlap. In 
fact, they might wonder why they do not intermingle more often. 
3.3 Spiritualism 
The purpose of this section is to show that Spiritualism often contains a form of 
spirit possession. At seances mediums deliberately seek contact with the spirits of 
departed people. Some mediums only receive clairvoyant information from spirits, 
while others enter a trance or meditative state to permit spirits to speak through 
them. In these cases the medium's voice and sometimes facial expressions may 
resemble that of the dead person, which can be regarded as voluntary spirit 
possession. Physical mediums may request spirits to produce psi phenomena, 
such as apports or levitations, as evidence of their existence, but sometimes these 
events occur unexpectedly. The English novelist Florence Marryat (1837-1899), 


--- Page 82 ---

73 
who regularly participated in seances with the most popular mediums of her time, 
describes an unexpected incident at the house of Mrs Guppy, a well-known physical 
medium. There were many guests in two adjoining, illuminated drawing rooms 
(Marryat, 1891/1973, p.138); Not wishing to participate in the second of two , 
seances, Mrs Guppy, who was a very stout woman, moved into the back drawing 
room with some of the guests. 
Suddenly, however, she was levitated and carried in the sight of all of 
us into the midst of our circle. As she felt herself rising in the air, she 
called out, 'Don't let go hands for Heaven's sake'. We were standing in 
a ring, and I had hold of the hand of Prince Albert of Solms. As Mrs 
Guppy came sailing over our heads, her feet caught his neck and mine, 
and in our anxiety to do as she had told us, we gripped tight hold of 
each other, and were thrown forward on our knees by the force with 
which she was carried past us into the centre.... The influence that 
levitated her, moreover, placed her on a chair with such a bump that it 
broke the two front legs off. (Marryat, 1891/1973, p.139) 
Mrs Guppy may have been concerned that she would have fallen more abruptly if 
the witnesses had stopped holding hands. This incident cannot be described as full 
possession, but it is reminiscent of poltergeist activity and illustrates that 
unexpected and seemingly uncontrollable psi events may occur to some mediums. 
Although numerous Spiritualists claim to be Christians, the Christian Church 
disapproves of attempts to contact spirits of the dead. The English Christian 
Exorcism Study Group describes organized Spiritualism as "a cult based on a 
somewhat credulous approach to highly selective aspects of paranormal 
phenomena" (Perry, 1987, p.46). They claim that messages relayed by a spirit 
medium may be generated within the medium's mind or picked up telepathically 
from the sitter, 
or they may be from discarnate sources.... A person who lays herself 
open to any stray psychic influences... may not always find herself 
becoming the mouthpiece of entirely good forces. Christians should be 
wary of any person who claims to be'controlled'by any spirit other than 
the Holy Spirit of God, and they should constantly test the spirits to see 
whether they are wholesome or baneful. (Perry, 1987, p.49) 
A similar religious bias is to be found in Leroy's 1928 book on levitation in which he 
reviews numerous cases from within and outside the Christian tradition, but some 
of his conclusions are not solely the product of his data. In his opinion, unless they 
are fraudulent, Spiritualist levitations require a preternatural rather than a 
miraculous explanation. He asserts that because "nothing but an intelligence is 
able to produce intelligent phenomena" (p.245), the entities that levitate mediums 


--- Page 83 ---

r-
74 
cannot be disembodied souls, because the spirits of the dead are 
unable — unless through a miracle—to have intercourse with the world 
of the living and to move matter. Hence the levitation of the mediums, 
whenever it is not a cheat, is a diabolical achievement. (Leroy, 1928, 
p.245) 
Leroy does not explain why spirits of the dead cannot facilitate psi events while 
diabolical forces can. One of his conclusions about human levitation is that 
Traditional Catholic theology does not admit a natural cause for 
levitation.... It regards it as a divine marvel or a diabolic trickery. The 
levitation of demoniacs or mediums is a parody, dismal or ludicrous, of 
the charisma of its saints. (Leroy, 1928, p.251) 
It is only supposition to claim that all psi phenomena are either divine or diabolical. 
People who perpetuate such beliefs should instead be advocating empirical 
research into these matters. This sort of theological bias helps explain why the 
medium Home was ordered to leave Rome in 1864 on the grounds of sorcery 
(Fodor, 1933/1966, p.173). 
: 
Most of the Christian priests and pastors that I interviewed gave almost identical 
answers when asked for their opinions about Spiritualism. For example, Brian 
believes that spirit mediums or channellers may be opening themselves up to evil 
forces and if a medium levitates "the power is coming from the devil rather than 
from God". Similarly, Philip believes that if a medium levitates 
I would suggest that Satan is at work... and that Satan is able... to perform 
duplicate miracles for those who choose to be deceived. In the Christian 
faith, the work of... trying to communicate with spirits is considered an evil 
work in itself. 
On the other hand, Brendan, who has studied Eastern religions as well as being a 
Catholic priest, believes that if someone levitates "it all comes into the same area of 
psychic phenomenon" and that the suggestion that God levitates some people while 
the devil levitates others is "a lot of hogwash". He points out that "the mind is 
capable of doing anything" but that psi events are "not essential to the spiritual 
journey or the journey to enlightenment". Brendan does believe in demonic forces 
but points out that if only one God exists then all other entities are "manifestations 
of some aspect of the Ground of Being". In his opinion, exorcism is "a religious 
ritual, [that] has a lot more to do yvith ... psychic healing". 
Spiritualists are more tolerant than the Christian Church about communicating with 
spirits, but are aware that a person's motives or character may dictate the outcome. 
Michael Bentine (1981), whose parents were Spiritualists, describes a case of 


--- Page 84 ---

75 
possession witnessed by his father who, as a scientist, was interested in 
researching the paranormal. The man concerned was a publican who had a 
remarkable talent for predicting racing winners. To enhance his abilities, he started 
holding seances and was soon completely under the control of a spirit called 'Old 
Pal' (p.84). At his wife's request a Spiritualist 'Rescue Circle' was assembled. The 
publican lapsed into a trance, the room became icy cold, he dribbled a foul liquid, 
his face swelled up and he became abusive. The determination of the circle 
members eventually prevailed and the entity departed. The grateful publican 
promised to abandon his previous ways, but his customers and vanity soon got the 
better of him. As Bentine writes "He died, raving mad, in the padded cell of a 
violent ward in a Kent mental hospital" (1981, p.88). The Rescue Circle could be 
seen as a form of exorcism, although Bentine describes it as a "group therapy of a 
specialized kind" (p.85). Bentine also describes how, at a seance with some 
trusted friends of his parents, his mother, a scrupulously honest and stout lady of 
eleven stone (70 kg), claims to have just imagined how exciting it would be to 
experience something like levitation when she suddenly found herself being 
whisked out of her chair, over the top of the seance table, and onto the lap of 
another sitter. Bentine (1976, p.55) claims that it would have been difficult for her 
to have walked around the table without being heard or bumping into something in 
the seance darkness. This cannot be described as an example of possession, but it 
seems to illustrate that whatever caused the involuntary levitation was linked to or 
capable of reading her thoughts. 
Whether possession is caused by spirits or the unconscious mind, one would expect 
Spiritualists to produce more cases of involuntary possession than other groups 
because of their frequent attempts to communicate with otherworld entities. 
However, the literature on possession does not appear to contain any statistics to 
support this suggestion. During my interviews with Spiritualists, they were asked 
what they thought caused, and how one might prevent, spirit possession. Most of 
them explained that the fear of demonic entities was exaggerated, and that 
Spiritualists generally take steps to ensure that the spirits they contact are of a 
pleasant or higher nature. Oliver explains that "We always ask one question when a 
spirit comes to us; do they come in the light of Christ? ... If we don't get any answer, 
then we do not make that communication". Barbara claims that people are 
possessed by their minds rather than spirits: "We do not believe another spirit entity 
can control you and possess your body". She also claims that poltergeist activity is 


--- Page 85 ---

76 
"created by the person's own mind, their own fear" and can require "psychological 
help". Most mediums claim to have a guardian spirit, guide or 'door keeper' who 
vets the spirits seeking to communicate with or through them. Maude, who has 
levitated several times during circles, points out that as a Christian medium she is 
devoted to serving others. "You pray to God for protection and you ask that angels 
or beings of light... will help you to raise your consciousness for the purpose of this 
service". Maude says that her guardian angel was present on occasions when 
"another entity has entered my body and spoken through it". She points out that 
I'm very careful that I don't let any old person in. I've got what I call a 
guiding structure that protects me on every level.... But if they bring 
someone through what I call my door keeper, then I will allow that. 
Edward, who claims to have worked with spirits for about sixty years, says that 
You'll hear some people say that a deep trance-medium must move out 
of his body, over there, while another person comes in. This is 
completely and utterly wrong. It's a simple matter of shifting minds.... 
And you as a medium will say 'yes' or 'no' if you are asked from spirit 
'will you let me come and speak through your voice-box?'. You either 
give it permission or you don't. 
Edward believes that possession cannot occur for any length of time, and is just "a 
state of mind that that person has put themselves into". He claims that "all of us 
have got what we call a doorkeeper.... That spirit person attached themselves to 
you at birth and he's there for the sole reason of protecting you against the 
unwanted, the unneeded". 
Para psychologists Dr Loftur Gissurarson and Professor Erlendur Haraldsson 
describe the investigations made by members of the Experimental Society in 
Reykjavik, Iceland, into the psi phenomena surrounding the medium Indridi 
Indridason (1883-1912). Initially Indridason's seances were held in the houses of 
Society members where sometimes he levitated so high that he hit his head on the 
ceiling and later complained about pains in the head. The seance darkness made 
visibility difficult, but the noise when he "crashed down on the floor, resulted in 
complaints from neighbours, and at least twice the Society had to find another flat 
to hold their seances" (Gissurarson & Haraldsson, 1995, p.61). What happened to 
Indridason on several occasions would be better described as poltergeist activity or 
even possession. Brynjolfur Thorhksson describes how, during one eventful night, 
he ran into Indridason's bedroom after hearing him scream for help. 
But then I see a picture that I shall never forget. Indridi is lying in the 
air in a horizontal position, at about the height of my chest, and swaying 
there to and fro, with his feet pointing towards the window, and it 


--- Page 86 ---

77 
seems to me that the invisible power that is holding him in the air is 
trying to swing him out of the window. I don't hesitate a moment, but 
grab the medium, and push him down onto the bed and hold him there. 
But then I notice that both of us are being lifted up. (Gissurarson & 
Haraldsson, 1995, p.71) 
Earlier, Indridason's spirit controls had said that a spirit called Jon had accumulated 
a lot of power during the day. It was therefore thought that Jon was the force 
behind that evening's levitation, furniture movement and objects being smashed 
and thrown around (Gissurarson & Haraldsson, 1995, p.70). Not only does this 
case reveal these researchers' belief that a spirit caused Indridason's levitation, but 
that it had accumulated its power during that day, although the researchers did not 
ask the spirit guides how the power had been acquired. The chaos around 
Indridason that evening also suggests that the psi events that occur during 
poltergeist activity, spirit possession and at seances could have the same cause. 
The true nature of spirits was questioned during research conducted by the Toronto 
Society for Psychical Research under the auspices of Dr Owen and his wife (Iris 
Owen, 1976). The group created a biography of a fictional character called Philip 
Aylesford (Chambers, 1998, p.59). Although not mediums, eight members of the 
Society then attempted to communicate with (the fictitious) Philip's spirit at regular 
seances. After a couple of years they succeeded and, as Chambers explains, "Philip 
then proceeded to retell the life story that had been created for him by the group" 
(p.60). Philip even provided some verifiable historical details of which the group 
had been unaware (p.60). When they first asked Philip to levitate the seance table, 
it only tilted and moved around the room, but eventually it lifted off the ground 
(Broughton, 1991, p.152). Although Spiritualists, shamans and poltergeist and 
spirit possession researchers are aware that some spirits can be petty, deceitful 
(Fisher, 2001) or harmful, the Philip experiments raise questions about the 
connection between spirits and the human mind. Chambers (1998, p.61) suggests 
that Philip could be seen as a "mental poltergeist" produced by the group's 
"collective consciousness" or perhaps as a rogue spirit "that used the group's 
created information to disguise itself". The Philip experiments have confirmed that 
some spirits may be unconscious projections, while others may be genuine, but not 
necessarily honest, entities. Nevertheless, this section has shown that spirit 
possession plays a major part in Spiritualism, although it is normally voluntary.

3.4 Alien Abductions 
There are several aspects of spirit possession in the UFO literature. Alien abduction 
narratives have only appeared within the last fifty years, although there are some 
who assert that UFO sightings and close encounters have existed throughout 
history. Edward McBride (2003, p.3) claims that an Egyptian report from 3,200 
years ago describing a rampaging demon in the sky is probably a UFO sighting, but 
back then such concepts were not available. Today there are people who claim that 
all aliens are evil or demonic entities. Dr Barry Downing, a pastor in the American 
Presbyterian Church and author of The Bible and Flying Saucers (1968), 
summarises some of the demonic theories about UFOs (Downing, 1980/2001, 
p.155). The secular-psychic theory is similar to the Jungian explanation for spirit 
possession. It suggests that modern society has suppressed part of its spiritual 
consciousness which is fighting back by projecting psychological archetypes into the 
skies. According to this theory UFOs "are a sign that the collective psyche of man is 
breaking down and, therefore, civilization is breaking down" (p.156). The secular-
supernatural theory suggests that aliens from an adjacent dimension are using their 
supernatural abilities to manipulate us in any way they wish, sometimes to our 
disadvantage, and the Christian fundamentalist religious-supernatural theory 
suggests that UFOs and aliens reveal that "the Devil and his demons have been set 
loose on Earth in preparation for the end and the second coming of Christ" (p.156). 
These speculative theories appear to demonstrate a powerful fear of the unknown. 
Martin Kottmeyer (2001a) asserts that "UFO belief is permeated by paranoid 
themes" (p.302). Many of these ideas are space age versions of traditional 
religious beliefs about the ubiquitous and subversive nature of demonic powers. 
For example, John Keel writes that UFOs 
seem to be nothing more than transmogrifications tailoring themselves 
to our abilities to understand. The thousands of contacts with the 
entities indicate that they are liars and put-on artists. The UFO 
manifestation seems to be... merely minor variations of the age-old 
demonological phenomenon. (Keel, 1973, p.299) 
One feature of the UFO phenomenon that directly resembles spirit possession is the 
concept of 'walk-ins'. As Dr Scott Mandelker explains/ the term walk-in 
describes a process of inter-dimensional, inter-planetary soul exchange, 
as well as the individuals who experience it. In this process, a soul 
from an older ET or angelic civilization (or a more evolved Earth soul) 
enters the voluntarily surrendered body and personality-system of a 


--- Page 88 ---

79 
human being, to better serve humanity and Earth. (Mandelker, 2001, 
p.636) 
Few ufoiogists take the concept of walk-ins seriously because there is little evidence 
to support it. The people who make these claims do not display other traditional 
symptoms of possession, they do not ask to be exorcised and cannot prove that 
their souls have been replaced by alien ones. As a result of his research, 
Mandelker (1995) claims that there exist two kinds of people who claim to have 
non-human souls; 'wanderers' who acquire these souls at birth, and walk-ins who 
acquire them later, and, in his opinion, neither group displays any overt pathology. 
Whoever aliens are, they appear to have the psi ability to remove abductees from 
locked houses and rooms, and during these encounters abductees may find 
themselves paralysed and unable to resist. Many abductees initially have problems 
recalling their experiences, although the memories may return later, especially if 
they resort to hypnosis. Similarly, after their exorcisms, most demoniacs have no 
memory of their possession experiences. Some repeat abductees assert that they 
value their close encounter experiences and that a form of mutual respect or 
cooperation eventually develops which enables them to question the aliens' 
activities and on occasions to refuse to participate in them. Some researchers 
assert that this positive perspective demonstrates the aliens' capacity to control 
abductees' minds, while others suggest that those who claim to value their 
encounters are attempting to avoid being psychologically crushed by their terrifying 
involuntary experiences. Some ufoiogists argue as to whether aliens are abducting 
people for positive or negative purposes. For example, in Secret Life (1992) and 
The Threat (1998), American historian and abduction researcher Professor David 
Jacobs adopts the attitude that aliens "are not here to help us. They have their own 
agenda, and we are not allowed to know its full parameters" (1992, p.305). Jacobs 
(2000, p.206) believes that researchers who do not regard abductions as having 
sinister motives (eg: Mack, 2000b) are being unrealistic. 
There is a similarity between some aspects of the UFO literature and Spiritualism, 
which as mentioned earlier, can be seen as a form of voluntary spirit possession. 
The Austrian para psychologist Rene Coudris (1997), who claims to have had a UFO 
close encounter, uses his wife as a trance channeller to communicate with the 
spirits of aliens who were supposedly killed in the Roswell UFO crash in America. As 
Klimo (1991, p.179) points out, mediumship is defined by some as communication 


--- Page 89 ---

80 
with spirits of the dead, whereas channelled information may come from any 
source. Channelling aliens and other discarnate entities is a popular New Age 
phenomenon, but, as Klimo explains, possession is still a possibility. "When an 
entity attempts possession, it is definitely a case of unwanted spontaneous 
channelling" (p.182). 
Many alien abductions occur at night, often causing experiencers, unless amnesia 
occurs, to be confused as to whether they have had a nightmare, visionary 
experience, lucid dream, OBE, sleep paralysis, or something else. These encounters 
may involve sexual scenarios with aliens (Ritchie, 1994, p.185), or what seems to 
be genetic engineering technology. Some women claim to become pregnant after 
these encounters, although the foetus may later disappear (Rodwell, 2002, p.159). 
Regardless of their veracity, these experiences can be seen as modern versions of 
those involving demonic entities called incubi and succubi. In the Christian 
tradition, an incubus is an evil spirit in the form of a man that appears at night and 
has intercourse with a woman, whereas a succubus appears as a woman and 
seduces a man (Ritchie, 1994, p.109). It has been suggested that incubi and 
succubi are poltergeist-like projections from the minds of people suffering religious 
sexual repression, while others believe that these entities actually exist. As with the 
Philip experiments, this debate illustrates how little is known about the link between 
spiritual entities and human consciousness. If the mind is capable of creating 
spiritual entities, then some incubi, succubi and aliens may be produced in this 
manner, but that does not necessarily mean that they do not 'exist' in the 
conventional meaning of this word. Patrick Harpur (1994) asserts that some 
entities can materialize from the otherworld whenever they wish. 
Ann Druffel (1998) provides nine resistance techniques to either prevent or cease 
abduction experiences. The "Appeal to Spiritual Personages" method (p.148) 
resembles Christian exorcism rituals to banish possessing demonic entities. 
According to Druffel, for this method to succeed the abductee only needs 
strong faith in a spiritual realm. Christ, Mohammed, the Lord God, 
guardian angels, the Archangel Michael, and other spiritual personages 
in which the experiencer has faith have been appealed to successfully. 
Religious artefacts also seem effective, provided the witness has faith 
that they hold some form of protective power. (Druffel, 1998, p.149) 
Verifying the effectiveness of this technique is difficult because there may be no 
witnesses to the experience, or the person may be mistaken in thinking that they 


--- Page 90 ---

81 
are about to be abducted. On the other hand, if aliens genuinely exist, they may 
stop if the potential abductee becomes too stressed, leading tQjhe mistaken belief 
that the spiritual personage appeal actually works. This section has shown that 
there are several aspects of the UFO and abduction phenomena that are similar to 
the possession syndrome and the religious beliefs surrounding it. Both fields 
involve a belief in spiritual or inter-dimensional entities with psi powers that have 
the capacity to interfere with a person's consciousness against their will. 
3.5 Martial Arts: Qigong 
I have not found any examples of spirit possession within qigong. However, some of 
the involuntary psi symptoms that demoniacs occasionally manifest resemble the 
extraordinary abilities that advanced martial arts practitioners seek to achieve 
voluntarily. The first involves excessive gravitation. The Catholic exorcist Amorth 
(1999, p.72) mentions a case that involves excessive gravitation or mass control, 
seemingly the opposite of levitation. A large, fourteen-year-old boy, who was 
supposedly possessed, had a tendency to sit with crossed legs and "no amount of 
force could lift him off the ground; it was as though he had turned to lead". On one 
occasion, three sturdy young policemen were baffled at their inability to move him 
(p.72). During Anna Eckland's exorcism, sometimes "her abdominal region and 
extremities became as hard as iron and stone" making her so heavy that "the iron 
rods of the bed bent to the floor" (Nicola, 1974, p.129). Oldridge (2000) quotes the 
English example of Alice Samuel who was hanged in April 1593 for "sending devils 
into the bodies of five young girls" (p.111). In her confession to the Bishop of 
Lincoln she acknowledged the reality of demonic possession and claimed that 
because the demons within her own body were so heavy, her horse had collapsed 
on her way to the questioning (p.lll). Even if Samuel's confession was extracted 
under duress it illustrates that there existed a cultural belief that linked spirit 
possession and excessive gravitation. Qigong practitioners learn grounding 
postures, one of which involves visualizing energy flowing down their legs which are 
rooted into the ground like a tree, thus making them heavier or harder to knock 
over. Practitioners who have mastered these techniques may voluntarily be using 
the same excessive gravitation psi force that occurs involuntarily during spirit 
possession, while at other times they may be using an opposing force to make 
themselves lighter, so they can leap faster, further, or higher. The question is how 
demoniacs involuntarily trigger these forces when martial arts practitioners have to 


--- Page 91 ---

82 
undergo a lot of training before they can achieve voluntary control of what may be 
the same power. 
A second similarity involves another rare symptom of spirit possession, which is that 
a lump is seen or felt to move around under the skin of the demoniac. Oldridge 
(2000, p . l l l ) quotes three historical examples in which invading spirits were 
experienced as something physical moving around within the body of the possessed 
persons, frequently within the stomach or belly. Cristiani (1974) reports that in the 
possession case of the Bantu girl Germana Cele, in addition to other horrifying 
physical symptoms, sometimes a "lump would form under her skin and travel over 
every part of her body" (p.106). Before their exorcisms, the lllfurth boys' stomachs 
would sometimes swell up enormously. "They would explain this by saying they had 
something like a ball in their stomachs and that a live animal was running up and 
down inside them" (Cristiani, 1974, p.95). Danaos (2000, p.104) describes the 
first three stages of neikung training. In stage one, pupils must learn to gather both 
yin and yang chi within their bodies. The yin chi is put elsewhere, but the yangchi is 
put into the dantien energy centre near the navel. In level two/the yang chi is 
compressed so that the dantien will hold twice as much. In level three, the pupil 
learns to make the dantien ball of energy mobile so that it can be moved anywhere 
within the body. Danaos describes a friend who reached this stage. 
This man had a 'ball' in his belly at the dantien point, a solid mass that 
he moved around at will. Manipulating the ball,... this man could pass 
ch'i energy into his arms and legs. One physician, upon examining him, 
had thought my friend had cancer when he felt the huge lump; the 
doctor had gone through the roof when my friend had caused the ball 
to dance around. (Danaos, 2000, p.106) 
At level four one learns to mix the large amounts of yin and yang chi that have been 
accumulated. As Master Chang explains, this may take several months or years, 
and during this time the yin and yang "float around inside the body, and the pain is 
incredible, constant, unbelievable. Only if you have the discipline to ignore it can 
you control them and put their power inside your dantien" (in Danaos, 2000, 
p.108). Combining yin and yang chi at this advanced level can be so dangerous 
that a pupil may die if something goes wrong (p.109). Qigong practitioners who 
have progressed to level four and beyond develop various psi abilities, but only if 
they refrain from sexual activity. There may be a connection between this martial 
arts training and a supposedly possessed, celibate nun or monk who feels 
something hard running around beneath the skin, and who also levitates — 


--- Page 92 ---

83 
something Master Chang is able to do. Similar energies may be involved, although 
one scenario results from sustained training and the other is involuntary. Another 
similarity is that qigong masters accumulate some of their chi through meditation, 
an activity to which some nuns, monks and ascetics also devote many hours. This 
does not explain, however, why children or secular people who do not mediate or 
are not celibate may develop these symptoms. When interviewed, qiqong master 
William agreed that the objects or entities that some possessed people feel running 
about within their bodies are probably the equivalent of chi energy. In his opinion, 
these people may be suffering some sort of malfunction of chi or psi energy within 
their bodies, which they can only describe in culturally familiar terms such as 
animals or demons. 
3.6 Mysticism 
Spirit possession in various forms exists in almost every religion and is not always 
seen as undesirable. For example, one could claim that a mystic, who is temporarily 
overcome by an ecstatic rapture, is possessed by divine or spiritual power, but he or 
she would probably welcome such an event. There are also cases where mystics 
suffer what appear to be intermittent possession symptoms, but they either learn to 
live with them or regard them as trials that they must endure. This section provides 
examples of mystics who supposedly endured unpleasant experiences which 
resemble possession symptoms and which again raise the question as to whether 
they are generated within the mind, by independent spiritual entities, or both. 
Jacques Lacarriere (1963) recounts some of the fourth century experiences of early 
Christian "communities of ascetics and monks in the desert wastes of Egypt, 
Palestine and Syria" (p.7). As he explains, 
A complete break with the world is not undertaken with impunity, one 
does not fast for years, hidden in the gloom of a cave or exposed to the 
scorching sun, without one's personality becoming completely upset. 
This trial... finally brings about in the ascetic certain psychical 
phenomena to which the writings bear surprising witness. Those weird 
shapes which appear to the hermits during their meditations by night or 
in the full glare of the noonday sun, those fiends, the fantastic 
creatures that come to tempt the ascetic... form the inevitable 
pageantry of those who have thought they were free of the world for all 
times, but have been unable to rid their minds of aggressive or alluring 
imagery. (Lacarriere, 1963, p.9) 
When interviewed, the priest David suggests that when the desert fathers talked 
about battling demons, they were actually personifying what was in their hearts, 


--- Page 93 ---

84 
"like lust, greed and pride; all that stuff". In a possible example of this, the desert 
mystic St Anthony the Great supposedly endured "repeated attacks made by 
demons, and so violent were they that he felt his body was being beaten black and 
blue and he then lay unconscious on the ground for several hours" (Lacarriere, 
1963, p.61). Lacarriere warns of hagiographical exaggeration in these reports, but 
believers seemed to consider such physical assaults as a sign of a mystic's 
advanced spiritual stature rather than the opposite. St Pachon claimed that, 
despite having spent many years in his cell "thinking of nothing but my salvation, I 
still continue to be tempted.... Not a single day or night has passed without my 
being tormented or persecuted by the devil" (in Lacarriere, 1963, p.184). The 
desert mystics regarded anything unusual or miraculous that happened to them as 
the work of either God or the Devil (p.172), whereas modern psychologists would 
probably regard them as unconscious mental projections caused largely by sensory 
deprivation. Lacarriere (1963, p.201) says that levitation is only mentioned three 
times in the texts he consulted. St Ammon supposedly levitated across the Nile 
because he was ashamed of removing his clothes to cross the water. The monk 
Zosimus reported that he once looked down when he saw Mary the Egyptian 
starting to pray, "But when he looked up again, he saw that Mary was raised a full 
cubit [about 50 cm] above the ground and that she continued to pray while 
suspended in the air" (p.201). And Shenute supposedly levitated before a judge 
after being charged for his activities against heathen temples (p.201). 
Cristiani (1974, p.38) compares St Anthony with St Jean-Marie Vianney, known as 
the Cure d'Ars, who was born near Lyons in 1786. Vianney was appointed cure 
(parish priest) of the small village of Ars in 1818 and Worked there until his death in 
1859, and for that entire period he stoically endued intermittent symptoms of the 
poltergeist-possession syndrome. Cristiani's (1974, p.20) explanation is that "If 
there are enemies of the soul, which we call demons, they could not fail to be aware 
very soon of the young priest's ambitions; and it would be inevitable that they would 
wish to nullify his work". This theory fails to explain why most other priests do not 
suffer similar symptoms. There were numerous unpleasant psi events that 
surrounded Vianney. Disturbing disembodied voices were heard at night, there was 
hammering on doors, the entire house would shake, and inside "there was a 
thundering sound as if several carriages were driving through it" (Cristiani, 1974, 
p.23). His bed caught fire, and once the noise was so loud that others rushed in 
believing he was being murdered, only to find him peacefully asleep, with his ,ied 


--- Page 94 ---

85 
inexplicably in the middle of the room. Vianney attributed these activities to the 
Grappin (his nick-name for the devil) and, to calm those around him, would remark 
that "The Grappin and I have got used to each other" (p.27). Vianney had 
remarkable clairvoyant and healing powers and could exorcise others with ease. 
His biographer, Abbe Monnin, claims that annually about twenty thousand people 
from all over Europe visited to be cured by him (in Fodor, 1933/1966, p.74). Once, 
during an evening service, Father Gardette saw Vianney gradually levitate "until his 
feet were above the ledge of the pulpit" (Treece, 1993, p.262). To dispel whatever 
entities seemed to be bothering him, Vlanney's own exorcism was arranged on 
several occasions but for various reasons never took place. Vianney's gifts and 
afflictions were enhanced or perhaps caused by his ascetic lifestyle; he hardly ate 
or slept and he regularly scourged himself (Cristiani, 1974, p.20). The English 
Spiritualist William Howitt claimed that "the truth probably is that M. Vianney had so 
reduced his body by fasting, penance and enormous exertion that he had opened 
himself to all kinds of spiritual impressions, in which the devil was sure to have his 
share" (in Fodor, 1933/1966, p.74). Rather than being persecuted by the Church 
for his demonic infestations, Vianney was venerated and eventually canonised 
because of the saintly manner with which he persisted with his parish work when 
most others would probably have fled in fear or lapsed into madness. Vianney may 
have had deep psychological conflicts which, as one of the two poltergeist activity 
theories suggests, became exteriorised because of his strong innate psi abilities. 
One can even speculate that his approved psi activities such as healing helped 
reduce or divert the energy behind his poltergeist-possession symptoms. 
Colin Wilson reports that exorcists are not always immune from possession. In the 
seventeenth century Loudun possession case, made famous by Aldous Huxley in 
The Devils of Loudun (1952/1970), "four of the priests who came to exorcise the 
'devils' were themselves possessed, and two of them died of it" (Wilson, 1981, 
p.47). Huxley and others believe that the possessed Ursuline nuns were probably 
faking their symptoms, but, as Wilson points out, if that was the case, how do we 
explain what happened to the exorcists? One of them, Father Sunn, "a remarkable 
mystic, became more-or-less insane for twenty-five years" (p.47), and Father 
Tranquille, who was a famous Capuchin preacher, "found himseif in the horrifying 
position of writhing around on the ground, listening to his mouth uttering 
blasphemies, while his mind remained a detached spectator. This continued until 
he died in a state of exhaustion" (p.47). Another of the exorcists, Father Lactance, 


--- Page 95 ---

86 
apparently suffered the same fate. Rather than being possessed by exorcised 
spirits, Wilson (1981, p.49) suggests that these priests, who apparently behaved 
with appalling cruelty during the exorcisms, may have became the victims of 
previously repressed parts of their own minds. If some cases of possession are the 
product of archetypes rising to the surface, then it is possible that a form of 
psychological contagion can affect those who are emotionally susceptible, when 
they are surrounded by others displaying these symptoms. As Wilson points out, 
"We are all of us 'divided selves'" (1981, p.49), which presumably means that most 
people have emotional conflicts which, in the appropriate cultural conditions, can 
lead to dysfunctional behaviour that resembles spirit possession. On the other 
hand, if possessing spirits do exist, it is possible that, as perhaps with the Cure 
d'Ars, they find it easier to invade the minds of those with innate psi abilities and/or 
deep emotional conflicts. 
It is hard to believe that the product of a mystic's mind can take on a physical form, 
let alone beat him or her unconscious, but the evidence suggests that this is 
possible. Alexandra David-Neel (1965) explains that "Tibetan mystics also affirm 
that adepts well trained in concentration are capable of visualizing the forms 
imagined by them and can thus create any kind of phantom: men, deities, animals, 
inanimate objects, landscapes, and so forth" (p.298). David-Neel was interested in 
discovering whether it was possible to create a tulpa, a phantom person, using such 
a technique. "I chose for my experiment a most insignificant character: a monk, 
short and fat, of an innocent and jolly type" (p.314). She went into seclusion and 
carried out the prescribed concentration exercises and rites. After a couple of 
months the phantom monk started to appear life-like. David-Neel then started on a 
tour of Tibet. Although she rode for many miles each day, the monk continued to 
accompany her, acting like a real person: "For instance, he walked, stopped, looked 
around him" (p.315). On one occasion a herdsman bringing a present into her tent 
assumed that the tulpa was a live lama. But then the "fat, chubby-cheeked fellow 
grew leaner, his face assumed a vaguely mocking, sly, malignant look. He became 
more troublesome and bold. In brief, he escaped my control" (p.315). David-Neel 
then "decided to dissolve the phantom. I succeeded, but only after six months of 
hard struggle. My mind-creature was tenacious of life" (p.315). One could claim 
that for six months David-Neel (1965) was partially possessed by a spiritual entity of 
her own making and that she was in a sense exorcising herself. She explains that 
Tibetan tradition warns that creating a tulpa can be dangerous for those who have 


--- Page 96 ---

87 
not reached a high degree of spiritual development. "Once the tulpa is endowed 
with enough vitality to be capable of playing the part of a real being, it tends to free 
itself from its maker's control" (p.313). She claims that there are stories of 
magicians being injured or killed by their creations. It is unclear what David-Neel 
means by the term 'vitality'. Is this some life-force or energy, like chi, that advanced 
meditators can accumulate in sufficient quantities to give life to a creation of their 
imagination? If David-Neel's claim that the mind can create independent physical 
entities is true, it throws into confusion the debate as to whether poltergeist activity 
and spirit possession are caused by spirits or mental projections, because it 
suggests that both arguments may at times be true. Another question that David-
Neel does not answer is what happens to a tulpa if it escapes its creator's control. 
Does it disappear into the spirit realm to join others of a similar nature, or does it 
take on an independent physical existence like ordinary humans? 
The last example in this section comes from Irina Tweedie (1979) who achieved her 
spiritual illumination at the feet of a Sufi master in India. One day an old man and 
his son, who was apparently possessed, arrived at the master's house. So that a 
crowd would not gather, the son sat on a step outside while the master stood in a 
doorway, obscured by a blind, staring at him silently. 
The young man ... had a rather simple and primitive look about him. 
Suddenly he uttered a loud cry and then began to howl like an animal, 
with his mouth wide open, his eyes glassy and spent, like the eyes of a 
dead man. The expression of his face was terrible to see; it was like a 
contorted mask. (Tweedie, 1979, p.92) 
Tweedie next observed that the man "was now lying on the ground having 
convulsions, froth streaming from his mouth, his face contorted and terrible" (p.9?). 
The master pointed his finger at the writhing body and repeated "Go away" twice, 
whereupon a terrible voice replied that it would comply. There was then silence and 
the tormented body lay still. A while later the son sat up smiling and looking human 
again. When asked what had caused the possession, the master explained that 
"These kinds of spirits are rather powerful elementals. If they want an experience 
on the physical level, then they attach themselves to a human being" (p.93). He 
then added that "If he comes back, / will burn him.... Sometimes they are rogues 
and then they come back" (Tweedie, 1979, p.93). The young man could not have 
been cooperating in an exorcism ritual because he was not participating in one. 
The Sufi master is asserting that some cases of possession are caused by spiritual 
entities. Like David-Neel banishing her tulpa, the master appeared to expel the 


--- Page 97 ---

88 
possessing elemental using the power of his mind, which suggests an interface at 
some level between human consciousness and the realm of spirits. Unlike most 
demoniacs, David-Neel and the Sufi master were spiritually developed, and their 
experiences confirm a link between mysticism and spirit possession. 
Interviews. During my interviews with Christian priests and pastors, they were 
asked for their opinions about spirit possession, poltergeist activity and exorcism. 
Many of them pointed out that exorcism was a rare event and that mental illness 
had always to be eliminated first. Their opinions about so-called demonic entities 
are predominantly negative and fearful. For example, Philip believes that 
poltergeist activity is the work of Satan. "People very rarely come out at the end of 
such a thing with any clear understanding of what has happened or why it 
happened. And to me confusion is one of the important tools of the evil one, 
Satan". Speculating that confusing psi events are the work of demonic entities 
creates an unwarranted sense of dread about the unknown. The entire history of 
medicine and science is about exploring the unknown, so this attitude is more likely 
to perpetuate confusion rather than reduce it. 
Both Francis and Gordon claim that the psi activities of shamans, Spiritualists, 
gurus and possessed people are probably demonic, which can be seen as an 
attempt to demonise spiritual activities other than their own. If a Christian saint can 
use psi healing powers then it seems inappropriate to discriminate against a guru, 
shaman or Spiritualist who does the same thing. Once, while on an overseas 
mission, Francis was speaking before a large crowd when "a woman began to 
manifest a demon". A local deliverance team removed her from the audience but 
next day Francis discovered that, although they had been throwing holy water and 
waving crucifixes at her, she was still screaming and hissing and several men were 
having trouble holding her. Reluctant to become involved, Francis quietly read 
aloud a deliverance prayer and "The moment I reached the amen, it left.... And she 
just collapsed to the ground; her colour came back" and she appeared to be healed. 
Francis admits he was surprised at the result, and believes that it happened 
because the prayer "was anointed by God" and he was using it in faith. "That's 
what gives you the power and the right to operate.... I just submitted myself to the 
divine majesty". Another explanation is that the possessed woman was healed 
because she unconsciously attributed a higher degree of spiritual power to Francis, 
an important overseas visitor, than to her local deliverance team. Francis' psi 


--- Page 98 ---

89 
powers — he claims to have once levitated and to have healing abilities — may also 
have helped. 'Submitting to divine majesty' could be seen as a way of attuning 
one's consciousness to some form of universal or transcendent psi healing power. 
Michael, who claims to "have exorcised some people who had demonic spirits 
within them," echoes Leroy's (1928) views when he claims that saints may levitate 
"when they are communing with God in a very special particular way" but that 
shamans and seances "can be quite demonic". Michael believes that the power of 
the Holy Spirit comes through some exorcists with more strength than with others. 
As with Francis, this suggests that exorcists with psi abilities will be more successful 
than those without them, regardless of what is causing the possession symptoms. 
Some priests acknowledge that negativity and tearfulness are not always 
appropriate. When asked what he thought of research into the spirit realm, Thomas 
replied that "I have no problems with trying to find out about the spirit world" and 
that "to me fear is something that holds us back and is debilitating. But I think also 
... we have to be realistic about some things and I think sometimes there can be a 
danger in these things". If the mind is able to create spiritual entities like tulpas, 
then surely the incessant fear of demonic beings displayed by so many Christian 
priests and pastors could help create or sustain their existence. Constantly 
worrying and preaching about something may inadvertently provide it with what 
David-Neel terms vitality. Even if one believes that possessing entities are mental 
projections, being obsessed about them may assist in their appearance^ 
3.7 Summary 
This chapter has shown that, apart from qigong, the groups contain some aspects 
of spirit possession.: This is perhaps to be expected because most of the groups 
believe in the existence of spiritual powers or entities with psi abilities, including 
spirits of the dead, from whom they attempt to obtain information, healing, spiritual 
guidance, or power. This may involve brief, voluntary spirit possession/but on 
occasions involuntarily possession occurs. Although the Christian Church forbids its 
followers to communicate with spirits of the dead, some dramatic examples of 
involuntary levitation occur to demoniacs, although the evidence does not suggest 
that these people — who seem to come from all walks of life and age groups - were 
attempting to interact with spirits. The reason they become possessed remains 
unclear. Among the groups that attempt to communicate with spirits, the examples 


--- Page 99 ---

90 
of levitation seem to be largely voluntary or the result of only brief periods of 
possession. This may be because Spiritualists and shamans try to understand the 
dynamics of the spirit world and how to avoid negative entities. Another reason that 
advanced practitioners in shamanism, mysticism, Spiritualism and qigong avoid 
unwanted spirit possession may be because of their rigorous spiritual or meditative 
training, whereas the average Christian practitioner'or priest shuns psi abilities and 
is normally only trained in theological matters. It seems that those who are unable 
to prevent themselves from becoming possessed are also unable to control their 
levitations. For example, the average demoniac or poltergeist sufferer seems to 
know very little about spirits or psi powers. Alien abductees may be slightly more 
knowledgeable because some of them have had psi abilities since childhood. 
Mystics, Spiritualists, shamans and advanced qigong practitioners seem to be the 
most informed about developing psi abilities. In brief, it appears that the more 
practical training you have in your group's conceptual map of the spirit realm and its 
link to human consciousness, the more unlikely you are to become involuntarily 
possessed and the more likely you are to be able to levitate at will. 
This chapter has also shown that many consciousness researchers are reluctant to 
discuss psi phenomena. Assuming that spirits do not exist because the mind 
seems capable of splitting is not the product of sound empirical research. If the 
mind interfaces with a transpersonal realm and is capable of producing tulpas, then 
independent spiritual entities may well exist, which in turn suggests that human 
consciousness is more complex than some psychologists think. If the conscious 
and unconscious mind form a continuum with a transpersonal realm, it is 
understandable that there is confusion about what causes levitation. Those who 
have undergone sufficient meditation training would regard their consciousness as 
a gateway to universal consciousness. In a sense they no longer have an 
unconscious mind because they now have considerable experience in deliberately 
entering that part of their minds using ASCs. They are therefore unlikely to become 
possessed, they may be able to levitate voluntarily, and may regard the argument 
as to whether spirits or one's own mind causes possession as a meaningless 
distinction because in a sense they are using the power of their own spirit or soul to 
levitate. Those who are ignorant about their own unconscious will understandably 
want to personify or demonise whatever unknown force possesses and perhaps 
levitates them. All this suggests that voluntary and involuntary levitation is most 
likely to occur during ASCs, which will be discussed in the next chapter.

Chapter 4. 
Altered States of Consciousness and 
Breath Control 
The purpose of this chapter is to show that the theme of breath control and altered 
states of consciousness (ASCs) runs through all of the seven groups. Levitation 
examples are provided where one or both of these phenomena are present, which 
suggests that they may be linked to its cause. Possession states involve ASCs, so 
one could query why separate chapters are needed to discuss these matters. While 
an overlap is acknowledged, this chapter demonstrates that some members of 
these groups believe that they can gain access to psi abilities by changing their 
level of consciousness, either temporarily or permanently, without any apparent 
symptoms of spirit possession, and a common way of doing this is by breath control. 
It is noted, however, that mystics largely indulge in ASCs to achieve enlightenment 
rather than psi abilities because, as discussed in a later chapter, there exist 
religious taboos against displaying any psi abilities that they might develop. A 
second reason why possession states and ASCs are being discussed separately is 
that the former is an ancient perspective that is often surrounded by many religious 
assumptions, while the latter is a modern concept that has been the subject of 
some medical, psychological and parapsychological research. Although still in its 
infancy, this research has not yet yielded any undisputed theories to explain a 
connection between ASCs, breathing techniques and psi abilities. Indeed, there are 
many neuroscientists who do not believe that psi phenomena even exist. 
The parapsychologist Charles Tart (1969; 1975) first coined the term altered states 
of consciousness. Because modern science is unable to define normal 
consciousness precisely, it is difficult to define ASCs. The term can refer to a wide 
range of consciousness states or medical conditions; for this research, the most 
relevant states are religious rapture, prayer, contemplation, meditative, visionary 
and trance states, shamanic ecstasy, sleep and dreams, hypnotic states, 
possession states and even death. There is little purpose in attempting to define 
these terms because the researchers and writers that I have quoted may use them 
differently. In addition, these states are often personal interior experiences whose 
content is not visible to others. Guiley (1991, p.8) defines ASCs as "Any of a variety 
of states characterized by a radical shift in the pattern of consciousness from one's 
'normal' waking state". She also notes that "ASCs h&ve been shown to be of some 
benefit in psi functioning, but have been difficult to study scientifically because of 


--- Page 101 ---

92 
their subjective and internal nature" (p.8). One of the few empirical means of 
assessing levels of consciousness is to measure brain-wave activity, although this 
technique cannot reveal subjective content. Researchers have divided brain 
frequencies into four levels: beta, alpha, theta and delta (Guiley, 1991, p.8). Beta 
(14-27 Hz) occurs during normal waking consciousness. Alpha (8-13 Hz) normally 
occurs during light hypnosis, meditation, daydreaming and just before and after 
sleep. Theta (4-8 Hz) occurs during light sleep, although some people can access 
this level during meditation. Delta (0-4 Hz) occurs during deep sleep. These 
categories do not define ASCs but they offer a perspective on what is happening 
during some of them. For example, advanced meditators from almost any spiritual 
tradition appear able to remain conscious while displaying theta brain patterns, 
whereas most non-meditators would be asleep at that level. Parapsychologists 
have also noted that, provided the subject remains conscious, slower brain patterns 
such as alpha are more conducive to psi activity such as ESP (Guiley, 1991, p.225). 
Kelly and Locke (1981, p.22) conclude that a large amount of anecdotal evidence 
supports "the central broad hypothesis of association between altered states and 
paranormal capacities". Similarly, Miller's (1995) study of people who unexpectedly 
survive disasters suggests that, by unintentionally entering an appropriate ASC, they 
evoke psi powers that alter the course of events in their favour. The healer 
Matthew Manning claims that in 1974 a group of scientists measured his brain 
patterns while in different states of consciousness, such as while "attempting to 
bend a key paranormally" (Manning & Rose, 1999, p.68). According to their report, 
Manning's spectrum was "characterized by a large concentration of energy in the 
Theta waveband," which is normally characteristic of sleep rather than the waking 
state (p.68). The psychiatrist Joel Whitton, who tested Manning to discover which 
part of his brain was producing this electrical energy, concluded that it was "the 
limbic system, which lies beneath the cerebral cortex and may be described as the 
old animal brain we relied on before the development of our intellectual brain" 
(Manning & Rose, 1999, p.69). Similar results from other people with PK abilities 
would strengthen this conclusion, and it is interesting to note that almost all 
mystical traditions claim that one needs to still the mind to access spiritual or 
transcendent power. This suggests that by temporarily closing down the modern 
cortex, another level of the mind can be encouraged to swing into action;

The anthropologist Kalweit (1992, p.78) claims that research has shown that "if a 
drum rhythm is synchronized with brain-wave frequencies, it is easier to achieve an 
altered state of consciousness," which, in his opinion, reveals the importance of 
"drumming, rhythm, and chant in tribal cultures". Because it appears that people 
listening to a shaman's rhythm "do not fall into a trance unless it is expected of 
them," Vitebsky (1995, p.81) adds that "while music and dance can have powerful 
effects, they do not so much induce trance as organise it in relation to a belief 
system". Kalweit (1992, p.78) notes that it takes courage "to let oneself go 
completely" and enter whatever state lies beyond, which illustrates the "struggle 
between letting go of the self and keeping a tight rein of waking consciousness to 
establish security through reason". A willingness to embrace unknown states of 
consciousness may explain why, in what seem to be similar circumstances, some 
people levitate while others do not. 
Most of the groups that produce levitation reports believe that all around us there is 
an invisible extended reality which holds the key to spiritual and psi abilities. They 
believe that the average person does not normally have conscious access to this 
spiritual realm, but it can be accessed by ASCs. Today, the spectrum of debate 
about this subject ranges from the"claim that these states of consciousness are 
produced by the biochemical stimulation of certain parts of the brain - called 
neurotheology by some researchers - to the assertion that this extended reality 
genuinely exists and contains independent spirits and divine beings. Books on 
neurotheology (Alper, 1998; McKinney, 1994; Winkelman, 2000) suggest that 
because religious experiences can be induced by stimulating parts of the brain, 
science can now assert that these experiences are neurologically-based rather than 
evidence of some form of external divinity. This claim might be true in some cases, 
but not necessarily in all cases. A part of the brain which can interact with spiritual 
energy from beyond the body might produce an illusional effect when artificially 
stimulated, but that does not prove that all spiritual experiences are illusory. More 
research is needed before the argument can be resolved either way. Another way 
of phrasing this issue is to ask whether human consciousness is entirely confined 
within the brain or whether we have a spirit or soul which can transcend the 
biological boundaries of the body. Those who believe in a closed model of the mind, 
which asserts that consciousness cannot extend beyond the physical body, tend 
also to deny the existence of psi phenomena. The open model, supported by most 
of the groups that produce levitation reports and by a minority of consciousness 


--- Page 103 ---

researchers (see Lorimer, 2001; Walsh & Vaughan, 1980), claims that certain ASCs 
enable a person to access a transpersonal level of reality. Bucke (1901/1969) 
refers to this state as cosmic consciousness, while others use terms such as unity 
consciousness (Drury, 1991), mind-at-large (Ring, 1992), self-realisation, 
enlightenment, or illumination. 
An obvious question to ask is what precisely it is that is altering during ASCs, and 
how this provides access to a transpersonal reality and psi abilities. A common New 
Age belief is that advanced spiritual states are accessed by moving one's 
consciousness to a higher vibrational frequency (Gerber, 2001, p. 169). This term 
mirrors the science of the electromagnetic spectrum, but fails to specify what is 
vibrating and how it can be measured. It is also somewhat confusing given that 
during meditation a person's brain patterns appear to go slower rather than faster. 
Others appeal to the scientific concept of signal to noise ratio (Gruber, 1999, 
p.143): reducing sensory input and stilling the mind (noise) supposedly provides an 
opportunity for normally inaccessible information (signal) or levels of consciousness 
to be experienced. Professor Robert Jahn, from Princeton Engineering Anomalies 
Research (PEAR), refers to the subjective feeling of love or resonance to explain 
some of the mind-machine PK phenomena produced in his laboratory. 
The most common subjective report of our most successful 
human/machine experimental operators is some sense of 'resonance' 
with the devices — some sacrifice of personal identity in the interaction 
— a 'merging', or bonding with the apparatus. As one operator put it: "I 
simply fall in love with the machine". (Jahn, 1995, p.402) 
Poets and romantics often describe being in love as an ASC, and mystics frequently 
advocate love as a way of opening oneself up to divine power. Eliminating one's 
personal identity or ego — often called union with the divine — is regarded as the 
ultimate step in almost all mystical traditions. Allowing one's entire being to 
resonate in an unrestricted manner with a universal force means that one has 
merged with, or even become, that force, which may explain why some of those who 
follow these guidelines develop psi powers, but this theory does not explain what 
precisely is resonating. 
Wilber (1977) refers to a 'spectrum of consciousness' and echoes the Buddhist 
spiritual belief that a person's innermost level of consciousness "is identical to the 
absolute and ultimate reality of the universe" (Wilber, 1980, p.75). Radin (1997, 


--- Page 104 ---

p.255) calls this belief transcendental monism; it "says that the mind is primary, 
and in some sense causes matter. The ultimate stuff of the universe is 
consciousness". But, as he points out, this theory merely "explains the mystery of 
mind and matter by referring back to the mystery of mind" (p.256). However, Radin, 
acknowledges that 
from the scientific and theoretical perspective, when two fundamental 
elements of the universe - mind and matter — are staring us in the 
face and no one can explain how they coexist, this gives us a strong 
signal that some of our usual assumptions about the nature of reality 
are probably very wrong. (Radin, 1997, p.256) 
Another perspective on the notion of an extended reality is to claim that it is so vast 
and overpowering that the normal human mind needs a filtering mechanism to 
reduce its impact. Aldous Huxley explains that 
Each one of us is potentially Mind at Large, but in so far as we are 
animals, our business is at all costs to survive.... Mind at Large has to 
be funnelled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous 
system.... Certain persons, however, seem to be born with a kind of 
bypass that circumvents the reducing valve. In others temporary 
bypass may be acquired either spontaneously or as a result of 
deliberate 'spiritual exercises'. (Huxley, 1963, p.23) 
Kalweit (1992, p.85) claims that "the trance state is actually the real perception of 
mankind," and Wilson (1995) writes that "mystical experiences are simply a 
recognition that there is something badly wrong with 'normal consciousness" which 
leads him to suggest that "the ultimate destiny of human beings is to evolve 
towards something altogether more godlike" (p.xix). Gruber, too, says that the 
driving force of all spiritual disciplines is 
the yearning for a fundamental lost state of consciousness in which the 
gods and man communicated.... Out of this desire ... ways and 
methods were developed to alter consciousness in such a way that 
phenomena that have no place in everyday conscious wakefulness 
would manifest themselves. (Gruber, 1999, p.143) 
Wilbur (1997, p.24) believes that transcending the consciousness-filtering system 
by the transformative experience of spiritual enlightenment is a rare and shattering 
event, which, if they are linked, suggests that powerful, voluntary psi abilities are 
available to very few people. On the other hand, Miller's (1995) research suggests 
that ordinary people, who are not advanced in any spiritual discipline, sometimes 
benefit from involuntary psi powers while only in temporary ASCs.

A recent theory about the possible link between consciousness, physical reality and 
psi abilities is the 'holographic paradigm', a term which derives from the fact that 
holograms store information in a 'non-local' fashion. Unlike a normal film or 
photograph, if one cuts up a hologram, each piece contains a slightly degraded copy 
of the entire original image, not just a part of it. Talbot (1991) quotes from 
researchers such as physicist David Bohm (1980) to support the suggestion that 
consciousness can access the quantum realm where information may be stored 
non-locally. This hypothesis suggests that, when in an appropriate ASC, like a 
computer connecting to the Internet, the mind can enter a non-local domain 
containing extrasensory information and PK power. Physics experiments have 
revealed that under certain conditions some sub-atomic particles manifest non-
locality (Talbot, 1991, p.52). Although not fully accepted by mainstream science, 
the holographic paradigm may begin to explain the transcendent nature of some psi 
abilities. Bohm (1980) proposes that physical reality has two 'orders'; a deep, 
enfolded, non-local level called the implicate order, and the normal, unfolded level 
called the explicate order. He believes that"everything in the universe is part of a 
continuum. Despite the apparent separateness of things at the explicate level, 
everything is a seamless extension of everything else, and ultimately even the 
implicate and explicate orders blend into each other" (in Talbot, 1991, p.48). 
Similarly, Grof (2001) asserts that "Each of us... appears to be a microcosm 
containing in a holographic way the information about the macrocosm. In the 
mystical traditions, this was expressed by phrases like: 'as above so below' or 'as 
without, so within'" (p.160). Although the holographic paradigm does not explain 
human levitation, it suggests that ASCs can assist access to a non-local realm that 
may facilitate psi abilities. 
A belief in a transcendent realm has existed throughout history and, although its 
descriptions reflect the cultural perspectives and lack of empirical research of those 
times, it may indeed exist. As LeShan (1974) demonstrates, modern, non-technical 
descriptions of what he terms Clairvoyant Reality provided by mediums, mystics and 
physicists are almost indistinguishable from each other. Today, some researchers 
and writers (Laszlo, 1996, 2003, 2004; McTaggart, 2001) are looking more closely 
at the evidence for such a realm - which some now call the zero point field — 
including its capacity to facilitate anti-gravity or levitation (Cook, 2002).

Ring's (1992, p.277) research reveals that 60% of people who have NDEs report an 
increase in psychic abilities. NDEs can be regarded as ASCs because people 
involved often claim to have been in an unusual state of conscious while they occur. 
Death itself is not normally regarded as an ASC except among those that believe in 
reincarnation or life-after-death. Blofeld (1974, p.190) explains that Tibetan 
Buddhism believes that "when the consciousness begins its wanderings in the 
bardo or intermediary state between death and rebirth, the words whispered by the 
Lama into the ear of the corpse can still reach him". 
An anthology of anecdotal psi experiences (Spees, 2001, p.272) contains what may 
be an example of involuntary mass control occurring shortly after death. In 
February 1996, a female patient who was very religious and weighed about 150 
pounds [68 kg) died at a nursing home. 
Several minutes after she was pronounced dead, one of the nurse's 
aides went into the room to prepare iier body.... Expecting that it would 
take two people to help with the preparations, the aide asked for 
assistance. When the two aides starred to move the patient's body, 
they found that she was as light as a feather. The aides were shocked 
— it was as though the dead woman's spirit had gone straight to 
heaven, (in Spees, 2001, p.272) 
No further details are provided, but it would have been informative to have weighed 
the body to see exactly how much lighter the woman had become, whether the 
weight-loss persisted, and if any medical theory could explain it. The suggestion 
that the woman's spirit had gone straight to heaven is simplistic and implies that 
almost everyone else's spirit does not. In an attempt to find a similar case I 
contacted the management of a chain of funeral parlours in Perth, Western 
Australia, and asked if any of their staff had had such an experience. I was 
informed that all the bodies are taken to a central location for processing and that 
the manager could not recall a similar incident. However, if the weight-loss lasts, 
for example, less than an hour after death, funeral parlour staff would probably not 
arrive soon enough to notice it. In an example that occurs just before death rather 
than afterwards, Blofeld quotes an English friend who 
during a visit to Sikkim, met a dying Lama who, while seated on the 
ground during the rites preparatory to death, temporarily lost control 
and, to his huge embarrassment, could not prevent himself from 
levitating although the occasion was so inopportune! (Blofeld, 1974, 
p.222) 
While noting that Buddhism frowns upon the display of psi powers, Blofeld does not 
explain why losing control caused the lama to levitate. Was it because his spirit was 


--- Page 107 ---

98 
rising out of his body? Remaining on the ground does not normally require self-
control, unless one is possessed by an unseen spiritual entity. Nevertheless, these 
examples imply that dying or death itself can sometimes be classified as ASCs. 
Ostrander and Schroeder (1973, p.292) quote a report that "Mikhail Drogzenovich, 
a fifty-three-year-old farmer from the Bulgarian village of Stara Zagora, could 
supposedly levitate". They continue: 
Before 'scientific witnesses'... the husky farmer closed his eyes and sat 
down in a field. After intense concentration, he apparently slowly 
began to rise in the air until he was about four feet [1.2 m] above the 
ground. His eyes remained closed, thereby ruling out mass hypnosis of 
the observers. He sat in the air some ten minutes, while witnesses 
checked that there were no rope, equipment, or mechanical devices 
connected to the hovering Drogzenovich. Then the farmer slowly 
settled back to earth. "Once I'm in the air," he was quoted as saying, 
"I'm unable to change my position. I get there by will power." 
(Ostrander & Schroeder, 1973, p.292) 
In this example intense concentration seems to count as an ASC. Will-power is a 
confusing term because, for example, a qigong master's will-power can throw an 
opponent backwards with no physical contact (Dong & Raffill, 1996), whereas an 
untrained person would probably produce no effect at all. No mention is made of 
Drogzenovich being in a trance, but he did not seem able to levitate while in a 
normal state of consciousness with his eyes open. Drogzenovich does not appear 
to fall neatly into any of the seven groups, but his claim only to be able to rise up 
and down matches that of Master Chang (in Danaos, 2000, p.158). Perhaps 
Drogzenovich has an unusually high sensitivity to the equivalent of chi energy. 
There may be several people in the world who unknowingly have this ability. Sitting 
down and concentrating intensely to see if one can levitate is not something that 
most people would ever attempt. 
Breath Control. An ancient Hindu technique for achieving ASCs and psi abilities is 
pranayama which refers to breath control. The origins of pranayama are uncertain, 
but, as Blofeld (1974, p.221) explains, similar techniques are used in Buddhism 
and Taoism in order to purify "the vessel of Liberation". 
Principally they are concerned with breath control, the control of some 
of the body's fluids and the cleansing of the psychic channels which 
link the chakras or psychic nerve centres to all parts of the body. The 
force which passes along the psychic channels is sometimes called 
Vayu (wind) but, like the Ch'i or K'i of Chinese Taoist adepts, it is of a 
kind much more subtle than the air we breathe. (Blofeld, 1974, p.221)

Pranayama is the fourth stage of Hatha yoga and is included in several other forms 
of yoga. In his translation of the yoga-sutras of Patanjali, Taimni (1975, p.258) 
provides a commentary on the five sutras that deal with pranayama. The simple 
justification for breathing exercises is that providing the body with more oxygen and 
prana increases the practitioner's vitality, but this explanation conceals a more 
complex and esoteric one. 
Prana which exists on all the planes of manifestation is the connecting 
link between matter and energy on the one hand and consciousness 
and mind on the other. Consciousness expressing itself through the 
mind cannot come into touch with matter and function through it 
without the intermediate presence of Prana. Matter in association with 
energy cannot affect consciousness except through the agency of 
Prana. That is why Prana is found on all the planes. It is necessary for 
the vitalization and functioning of all vehicles of consciousness, 
physical or superphysical. (Taimni, 1975, p.258) 
Paul Brunton (1937/1970, p.156) claims that "the stilling of the breath tends to 
still the thoughts," but also notes that 
The vital force immanent in breath and the mental force which 
activates the brain, arises from a common source. That source is the 
One Life-Current which permeates the universe and, in each human 
being, becomes his Divine Self, his Overself. (Brunton, 1937/1970, 
p.156) 
The ubiquitous nature of prana or chi may explain why it can supposedly be used for 
healing, levitation and other psi powers. Taimni (1975, p.259) claims that prana is 
"a real, highly specialized kind of composite energy with a material basis which is 
entirely different from the other kinds of energies working in the body". So, 
although prana is not the same as breath, one can manipulate its currents by 
learning to control one's breathing. The exact means of doing this are complex, 
dangerous and require years of training under the supervision of an advanced 
teacher. Several texts claim that pranayama may eventually produce certain psi 
abilities including levitation (Richards, 1980, p.81; Taimni, 1975, p.346). Some of 
the techniques involve breathing alternately through each nostril; learning to 
breathe more slowly; the retention of the breath for increasing periods of time; and 
reducing the 'breath length', which refers to the distance from the nostrils that 
one's breath can be detected. For example, Johari (1989, p.51) reveals that, by 
reducing the breath length from twelve to six finger widths, one acquires the "power 
to fly in the air and sky," and, at four finger widths, one gain the laghima (lightness) 
siddhi, which seems to refer to levitation.

A modern breathing technique to achieve ASCs — or non-ordinary states of 
consciousness (NOSC), as he calls them - used by psychiatrist Stanislav Grof 
(1993, p.20), is called Holotropic Breathwork which includes deep and rapid 
breathing. Exactly why this technique produces ASCs is unclear, but it may result 
from varying the ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide within the body. Grof notes that 
All the cultures with the exception of the Western industrial civilization 
have held NOSC in great esteem and spent much time and effort to 
develop various ways of inducing them. They used them to connect 
with their deities, other dimensions of reality, and with the forces of 
nature, for healing, for cultivation of extrasensory perception, and for 
artistic inspiration. (Grof, 2001, p.154) 
The following levitation example involves a change in breathing. Noel works as a 
psychic for a leading Australian woman's magazine, and claims to have levitated 
twice when he was 16 or 17. On both occasions — the first time outside in a 
national park and the second time indoors on a lounge — he was with a small group 
of friends at night discussing spiritual matters. Noel decided to try to levitate. 
I lay down, concentrated on slowing down my breathing which in turn 
seemed to slow down my heartbeat because my friends couldn't find a 
pulse, hear me breathe or hear a heartbeat, but I was fully conscious 
and talking to them. I then thought 'light' feelings, like I imagined 
myself floating, being weightless. I could feel when I lifted off the 
ground and off the lounge. It was slow and gradual but I knew exactly 
when. My friends said I lifted a couple of inches [6 or 7 cm] both times. 
On returning to the ground there was a massive burst of energy which 
jarred my entire body. (Personal communication, 15 July 2003) 
Noel claims that his psi abilities began after an NDE "when I drowned at age 
seven," and that spirits were not involved in his levitations. His explanation is "that 
the power of the human mind and the control we have over our bodies and the 
energy that surrounds us all is far greater than many people realise." He believes 
that he was able to levitate because he had "a natural spiritual attunement to the 
energy, and certain spiritual experiences including visitations, visions, and astral 
travel". Noel describes the burst of energy and jarring that he experienced when he 
returned to the ground as his arms, legs and torso arching for a second as if he was 
"being shocked". Noel's brief levitation may have been facilitated by the equivalent 
of chi energy, and the burst of energy he experienced afterwards was perhaps yin 
chi rushing from the ground into his body to replace the energy that he had 
consumed. Danaos (2000; 2002) frequently claims that a burst of chi energy can 
feel like an electric shock.

4.1 Shamanism 
Eliade (1951/1989), Harner (1990), Kalweit (1992) and Vitebsky (1995) agree that 
ASCs are essential to shamanism. "Some sort of trance is fundamental to both 
shamanism and possession, but a shaman's trance, unlike that of a possessed 
person, is mostly highly controlled" (Vitebsky, 1995, p.64). Eliade (1951/1989, 
p.5) explains that "the shaman specialises in a trance during which his soul is 
believed to leave his body and ascend to the sky or descend to the underworld''. 
Shamanic initiations may occur during dreams or visions: "But usually sicknesses, 
dreams, and ecstasies in themselves constitute an initiation; that is, they transform 
the profane, pre-'choice' individual into a technician of the sacred" (p.33). Eliade 
(1951/1989, p.107) notes that "What differentiates a shaman from any other 
individual in the clan is not his possessing a power or a guardian spirit, but his 
ecstatic experience". ASCs enable shamans to fulfil their various roles: "Healer and 
psychopomp, the shaman is these because he commands the techniques of 
ecstasy.... Through his own ecstatic experience he knows the roads of the 
extraterrestrial regions" (Eliade, 1951/1989, p.182). It seems that access to the 
"mystical geography" of the spirit realms provides shamans with their psi abilities. 
Harner (1990, p.47) differentiates between ordinary states of consciousness (OSC) 
and shamanic states of consciousness (SSC), which are used when the shaman 
enters nonordinary reality, otherwise known as the spirit realm. 
The shaman moves back and forth between the two realities 
deliberately and with serious intention. Whichever the reality, the 
shaman thinks and acts in the way appropriate to it, and has as his 
objective the mastery of both his nonordinary activities and his ordinary 
activities. Only he who successfully masters his actions in both realms 
is a master shaman. Both personal realities of the shaman, the 
nonordinary and the ordinary, have their correlative states of 
consciousness. Each reality may be coped with successfully only when 
one is in the state of consciousness appropriate to it.... A master 
shaman is fully aware of the appropriate consciousness for each 
situation with which he is faced, and enters into that state of 
consciousness as needed. (Harner, 1990, p.47) 
Harner (1990, p.49) points out that the depth of a shaman's SSC may be confusing 
for an observer. To achieve the same results, an initiate shaman may need to enter 
a deep trance, while an experienced shaman may be in so light a trance that an 
observer does not notice it. Shamans in different parts of the world use different 
techniques to achieve SSCs, such as drumming or chanting. "For an experienced 
shaman ... just a few minutes of the familiar rattling and/or drumming is usually 


--- Page 111 ---

102 
sufficient to achieve the light trance in which most shamanic work is done" (Harner, 
1990, p.51). If chanting is used, "The songs tend to be repetitive and relatively 
monotonous, mainly increasing in tempo as the shaman approaches the SSC. They 
may have the latent function of affecting central nervous system activity in a 
manner analogous to yogic breathing exercises" (Harner, 1990, p.53). 
Blofeld (1960) describes an incident involving a shamanic trance and something 
resembling levitation in a mountain village in Thailand. After Blofeld arrived, a 
villager fell dangerously ill and "most people thought it was because I had sucked 
his soul into my camera" (p.125). That evening, after hearing drumming and 
droning coming from the sick man's hut, Blofeld went to investigate. In the middle 
of the poorly lit room "was the Meng-Gong or tribal magician, his face hidden by a 
black mask" (p.126). The shaman, whom Blofeld describes as being in "a state of 
trance" (p.126), 
was seated with his back to me on a bench some three feet [90 cm] 
high, thumping a drum and intoning a ritual in a voice full of power, but 
frighteningly inhuman. Now and then, an extraordinary, indeed a really 
awful, thing would happen. With a frightful scream, he would shoot 
about four feet [1.2 m] into the air and land back upon the bench with 
such force that it quivered threateningly. Such a movement by a 
seated man whose legs never once straightened for the jump was so 
uncanny that I actually felt a cold sweat start from my pores. It was 
much more horrible than words can convey. (Blofeld, I960, p.126) 
The psi power produced by the shaman's ASC seems to have enabled him to heal 
and almost levitate. Inexplicably shooting into the air sometimes occurs to 
pranayama practitioners and is thought to be the result of kundalini energy. 
In the next two reports a shaman puts another person into a trance before levitating 
him, although it is unclear whether the psi energy flows from the shaman or 
elsewhere. The reports are by the conjurer Harry Kellar "who prided himself on his 
ability to detect tricks of any kind" (Inglis, 1979, p.25). Kellar travelled the world 
observing magicians and wonder-workers in an effort to widen his repertoire, and 
was prepared to acknowledge the probable psi nature of an event if he was unable 
to detect any trickery. The first levitation took place in Natal. Around his camp fire 
one evening, after Kellar had demonstrated a few conjuring tricks, the locals 
produced their witch doctor "who at first seemed reluctant to give his consent to an 
exhibition of his powers before me" (Kellar, 1893, p.80). The Zulu witch doctor then 
took a knob kerry or club and fastened it at the end of a thong of 
rawhide about two feet long. A young native, tall and athletic, whose 


--- Page 112 ---

eyes appeared to be fixed upon those of the conjuror with an 
apprehensive steadfastness, took his own knob kerry and fastened it at 
the end of a similar thong of hide. The two then stood about six feet 
[1.83 m] apart in the full glare of the fire, and began, all the while in 
silence, to whirl their knob kerrys about their heads. I noticed that 
when the two clubs seemed, in their swift flight, almost to come in 
contact, a spark or flame passed or appeared to pass from one of them 
to the other. The third time this happened there was an explosion, the 
spark appeared to burst, the young man's knob kerry was shattered to 
pieces, and he fell to the ground apparently lifeless. The witch doctor 
turned to the high grass a few feet behind us and gathered a handful of 
stalks about three feet [90 cm] long. Standing in the shadow and away 
from the fire, he waved, with a swift motion exactly similar to that of the 
clubs a few minutes before, the bunch of grass around the head of the 
young Zulu, who lay as dead, in the firelight. In a moment or two the 
grass seemed to ignite in its flight, although the witch doctor was not 
standing within twenty feet [6 m] of the fire, and burned slowly, 
crackling audibly. Approaching more closely the form of the native in 
the trance the conjuror waved the flaming grass gently over his figure, 
about a foot [30 cm] from the flesh. To my intense amazement the 
recumbent body slowly rose from the ground and floated upward in the 
air to a height of about three feet [90 cm], remaining in suspension and 
moving up and down, according as the passes of the burning grass 
were slower or faster. As the grass burned out and dropped to the 
ground the body returned to its position on the ground, and after a few 
passes from the hands of the witch doctor, the young Zulu leaped to his 
feet, apparently none the worse for his wonderful experience. (Kellar, 
1893, p.80) 
Kellar's only comment is that "the exhibition I have just described, was, I think, the 
most remarkable that has come under my vision" (1893, p.81) which implies that 
he thought no trickery was involved. The sparks and fire suggest that the Zulu 
shaman was using the equivalent of yin and yang chi energy to levitate the young 
man. Some of yang's qualities are that it can set fire to things and opposes gravity, 
while yin is passive, comes from the ground and is related to the pull of gravity, 
which suggest that levitation requires more yang than yin energy. Master Chang is 
capable of using his chi "to set a crumpled-up newspaper ablaze" (Danaos, 2000, 
p.xii). The Zulu shaman may have been using the dried grass as a measure of the 
available amount of yang chi. When it burst into flames after being waved around 
in the air, he knew he had enough energy to levitate the young man whose 
movement upwards increased with the frequency of the burning grass being waved 
near him, and who sank to the ground when the grass ceased burning. Although 
speculative, this makes some sense of a seemingly incomprehensible situation. 
From the start of the incident the young Zulu appeared to be under the influence of 
the witch doctor, like 3 hypnotist and his subject. His levitation while in a trance 
supports the link between ASCs and psi phenomena.

An American businessman who regularly travels to China provides an example of chi 
energy causing fire. He claims that in Beijing he sought healing from a qigong 
master because he has a supposedly incurable genetic disease of the stomach. 
While he lay on a bed in front of several witnesses the master stood over him and 
beamed chi energy at him with his hands. To the businessman's astonishment his 
shirt burst into flames causing significant burns to his stomach and chest (Personal 
communication, June 2003). This report appears to support the claim that chi can 
heal and set fire to things. 
Kellar's second levitation example involving an ASC occurred "during the winter of 
1875-6" in the Great Plaza of Calcutta before the then Prince of Wales and about 
fifty thousand spectators. "The old fakir who was the master magician of the 
occasion did his work out in the open plaza" which led Kellar (1893, p.78) to 
conclude that no hidden equipment was being used. 
After a salaam to the Prince, the old fakir took three swords with 
straight cross-barred hilts, and buried them hilt downwards about six 
inches [15 cm] in the ground. The points of these swords were very 
sharp, as I afterwards informed myself. A younger fakir... then 
appeared and, at a gesture from his master, stretched himself out upon 
the ground at full length, with his feet together and his hands close to 
his sides, and, after a pass or two made by the hands of the old man, 
appeared to become rigid and lifeless. A third fakir now came forward 
and taking hold of the feet of his prostrate companion, whose head was 
lifted by the master, the two laid the stiffened body upon the points of 
the swords, which appeared to support it without penetrating the flesh. 
The point of one of the swords was immediately under the nape of the 
man's neck, that of the second rested midway between his shoulders, 
and that of the third was at the base of his spine; there being nothing 
under the legs. After the body had been placed on the sword-points the 
second fakir retired, and the old man, who was standing some distance 
from it, turned and salaamed to the audience. The body tipped neither 
to the right nor to the left, but seemed to be balanced with 
mathematical accuracy. Presently the master took a dagger with which 
he removed the soilround the hilt of the first sword, and, releasing it 
from the earth, after some exertion, quietly stuck it into his girdle, the 
body meanwhile retaining its position. The second and the third swords 
were likewise taken from under the body, which, there in broad daylight 
and under the eyes of all the spectators, preserved its horizontal 
position, without visible support, about two feet [60 cm] from the 
ground. A murmur of admiration pervaded the vast throng, and with a 
low salaam to the Prince, the master summoned his assistant, and 
lifting the suspended body from its airy perch they laid it gently upon 
the ground. With a few passes of the master's hand the inanimate 
youth was himself again. (Kellar, 1893, p.79)

105 
The fakir used 'passes' to induce and end the levitator's trance, a term which 
derives from mesmerism, animal magnetism and hypnotism in the eighteenth 
century when some healers found that they could induce trances in their patients by 
passing their hands over them. Exactly how passes work is not clear, but in those 
days psi abilities were called the 'higher phenomena' of mesmerism or hypnotism 
because they occurred in a significant percentage of entranced subjects (Inglis, 
1989, p.52). 
4.2 Spirit Possession 
Whether spirits exist or not, spirit possession appears to involve ASCs because 
possessed people do not appear to be in their usual state of mind. Whether 
demoniacs have had their consciousness invaded by spiritual entities, or whether 
their symptoms are the result of archetypes rising from within their minds, or some 
other emotional affliction, their consciousness is clearly profoundly altered during 
the possession. Cramer (1979) claims that "perhaps the most essential symptom 
of demoniacal possession is amnesia" (p.23), meaning that those who are 
successfully exorcised generally have no memory of what happened to them, which 
again suggests they have been in an ASC. After his exorcism Theobold Burner was 
unable to recognise the people who had constantly been around him for the four 
years of his possession (Nicola, 1974, p.124); Cramer also links such ASCs to psi 
events. 
Demoniacal possession involves a division of consciousness, and 
without such a division the production of paranormal phenomena 
becomes at best severely limited or, more probably, impossible, since 
these intense psychical events cannot be consciously willed but are at 
the mercy of the forces of the unconscious psyche. (Cramer, 1979, 
p.24) I 
Cramer does not explain why he believes that only the unconscious psyche can 
I 
' 
• 
produce psi pvents, but it appears that after sufficient meditation — which can be 
seen as a method of consciously accessing the unconscious mind — some mystics 
can deliberately cause psi events, while others need to be in deeper ASCs to access 
these powers. Cristiani's (1974, p.70) list of posscr-r'on symptoms do not include 
psi phenomena, but many of them suggest that the person would be in an ASC. It is 
unlikely that all these symptoms would occur at once, and several of them can be 
caused by medical conditions that have nothing to do with demonic forces. Some 
of the symptoms are: 
(1) Convulsions, displaying an intelligence foreign to that of the patient 
... (2) extraordinary movements which could not be produced without 


--- Page 115 ---

106 
long practice, such as jumping, dancing, balancing feats... (3) 
distortions, intolerable pain ... (4) sudden loss of senses and feelings... 
(5) animal cries, strange howlings, of which the patient is unconscious 
... (6) strange and demonic visions in an otherwise normal person; (7) 
sudden and violent rages ... (8) inability to swallow or retain blessed 
food or drinks. (Cristiani, 1974, p.70) 
The remarkable feats of agility displayed by some seemingly possessed people 
seem to involve ASCs and mass control. Leroy (1928, p.17) quotes the 1857 
example of two girls from Morzines who "were taken with strange fits which some 
people considered demoniacal''. The girls could climb trees with astonishing speed 
"but were quite at a loss how to climb down if the fit subsided when they were at 
the top" (p.18). Hippolyte Blanc describes how the girls "climbed with unusual... 
rapidity up to the topmost branch of trees forty or fifty metres high, leapt from there 
with a somersault on to another tree several metres off, [and] climbed down with 
their heads downwards" (in Leroy, 1928, p.18). On another occasion a supposedly 
possessed boy climbed a huge fir tree on the way back from his father's funeral and 
balanced on his head at the top while singing. His brother shouted at him to 
behave himself and come down. The boy seemed to come out of his trance, 
became frightened and called for help. The brother on the ground rather cunningly 
called out for the devil to possess him again so he could descend. "The fit caught 
him again; he stopped crying and climbed down with his head downwards as fast as 
a squirrel" (Leroy, 1928, p.18). Although the extraordinary strength and agility 
exhibited during ASCs appears to be involuntary in demoniacs, some advanced 
martial arts practitioners and athletes learn to achieve them voluntarily by 
meditating or focusing their minds appropriately, which can also be called ASCs. 
Why mass control and exceptional abilities occur during ASCs and to what extent 
they are paranormal is unclear, but the evidence confirms that spirit possession 
involves an involuntary alteration to normal consciousness. 
4.3 Poltergeist Activity 
Current explanations are that poltergeist activity is either caused by mischievous 
spirits, by projected PK powers from the unconscious mind of the person who is the 
epicentre of the activity, or by a combination of both theories. After reviewing 500 
examples, Gauld and Cornell (1979, p.359) conclude that some cases are the work 
of "a aiscarnate entity" while other are caused by "a living agent". Playfair's (1980) 
composite theory is that the living agent's unconscious PK energy is being hijacked 
by mischievous spirits, which assumes that the unconscious mind interfaces with a 


--- Page 116 ---

107 
spirit realm. Rather than resulting from deliberate ASCs, the living agent theory 
suggests that poltergeist activity happens when, for whatever reason, a person's 
emotional conflicts have not entered, or have been banished from, their normal 
level of consciousness. In other words, rather than attempting to expand the 
boundaries of their consciousness as mystics and shamans seem to do, these 
people are unconsciously doing the opposite or, to put it another way, their minds 
have split into two parts that do not communicate with each other. So, although 
poltergeist activity may not be the result of people deliberately entering ASCs, these 
theories postulate an unconscious realm from which emotional conflicts are 
projecting PK powers beyond the confines of the physical body, which means that 
part of the living agent's mind is in the equivalent of an ASC. Rogo (1990, p.255) 
even suggests that relieving unresolved tensions this way can at times be 
therapeutic. Roll (1976) notes that the human agents sometimes experience 
dissociated states, which is another term for ASCs. Gauld and Cornell (1979) report 
a case where the agent entered a trance and "talked with unusual freedom of her 
dissatisfactions. During these trances, there were no poltergeist phenomena — it 
was as though the two were alternative outlets for the same repressed emotions" 
(p.340), which appears to support the unconscious PK rather than the mischievous 
spirits theory. A person may also experience trances when poltergeist activity 
expands into the poltergeist-possession syndrome. For example, on several 
occasions, Janet, the young girl at the centre of the Enfield poltergeist case, entered 
a violent trance (Playfair, 1980, p.106), and once she started crying in her sleep 
and then became hysterical. Because the researchers were unable to wake her, 
they concluded that she was in some sort of trance (p.63). 
Matthew Manning (1974, p.75) describes how, when he was fifteen, he could at 
times reduce the poltergeist activity around him by producing automatic writing. He 
first noticed this one day while writing an essay. His hand involuntarily started to 
write material that he knew nothing about, and simultaneously the poltergeist 
activity decreased. "Matthew realised that he could control the poltergeist 
manifestations by allowing himself to be used as a channel for automatic writing. 
Since then Matthew has taken down many hundreds of automatic messages" 
(p.75). Many of these messages appeared in different styles of handwriting and 
sometimes contained verifiable information of which Manning was not consciously 
aware. Whether this seemingly clairvoyant information comes from disincarnate 
entities or the unconscious mind, the fact that using automatic writing as an outlet 


--- Page 117 ---

108 
can decrease poltergeist activity reveals a link to the mind. Whether people 
producing automatic writing are in an ASC or whether just the parts of their minds 
that control their hands and language have become dissociated from normal 
consciousness, it seems clear that at least some cases of poltergeist activity are 
closely related to unusual aspects of consciousness. Although poltergeist activity is 
still an unresolved issue, it frequently seems to be connected to unconscious 
emotional conflicts and the living agents sometimes enter trances. Shamans and 
Spiritualists deliberately enter ASCs to interact with spirits or access psi powers 
whereas in poltergeist activity, and perhaps in spirit possession, it is as if this 
mechanism is activated unconsciously and/or involuntarily. 
4.4 Spiritualism 
ASCs and regulated breathing feature strongly in Spiritualism because spirit or 
trance mediums frequently slow their breathing and go into trances or meditative 
states during seances. Eric Post (1946, p.116) reports that Spiritualists 
acknowledge that the deeper the medium's trance "the better the phenomena". He 
explains that there are three stages of trance. The first is "the subliminal trance, in 
which the medium is partly conscious of his or her surroundings but sees everything 
more or less distorted". The second stage is "the subliminal trance in which contact 
with material things is entirely lost and the medium seems to be conversing with 
spirits, often repeating in a low voice what they have said". The third stage is "deep 
trance, in which the body of the medium is totally unconscious and anesthetic" 
(p.116). Fodor (1933/1966, p.37) writes that it is a "common observation that 
trance begins with a change in the rhythm of breathing" and that in yoga, psychic 
development is also "attributed to proper breathing". He also notes that, apart from 
acknowledging these connections, neither psychical nor medical researchers seem 
able to provide a convincing explanation for them. Speaking of trance states, 
Johnson explains that 
A 'medium' or a 'sensitive' can pass voluntarily into one of these states, 
in which consciousness is withdrawn to an interior level of the self, and 
can at the same time maintain a 'communication line' — by writing or 
speaking to those around. It is therefore possible for a sensitive to 
exteriorise knowledge possessed by levels of his own deeper self. 
(Johnson, 1955, p.126) 
As an example of this, Playfair (1980, p.64) recounts how, in an attempt to 
communicate with the Enfield poltergeist, a Spiritualist couple, George and Annie 
Shaw, visited the house. Annie sat in the middle of the living room and "began to 


--- Page 118 ---

109 
breath heavily" before entering a twenty minute trance during which she took on the 
personalities and voices of some of the poltergeist entities while her husband 
sternly instructed them to depart. The medium Eusapia Paladino would also slow 
her breathing before entering a trance (Fodor, 1933/1966, p.390). Witnesses at 
one of her seances described her being levitated on her chair while entranced. 
Both her hands were being held by researchers when a voice speaking through her 
announced that she would be lifted onto the table. Without hitting anything, the 
chair with Paladino on it was deposited on the table and a while later returned to 
the floor (Fodor, 1933/1966, p.199). Gissurarson and Haraldsson (1995, p.61) 
provide several examples of the entranced medium Indridi Indridason and his chair 
being levitated. Once, during a darkened seance, the medium was deliberately put 
on a creaky basket chair which enabled the sitters to track its movement as it 
levitated over their heads and was "rather noisily deposited on the floor" behind 
them. "Then the light was immediately lit and there sat the medium unconscious 
(in a deep trance) in the chair" (Gissurarson & Haraldsson, 1995, p.62). 
Sometimes at Indridason's seances a 'watchman' was used to maintain physical 
contact with the medium while the lights were off. On one occasion the watchman 
called out that Indridason was being pulled up into the air "with his feet turned 
towards the ceiling and his head downwards" and that the levitation force was so 
great that he could only just prevent himself from being lifted into the air with the 
entranced medium (p.77). 
Harry Kellar, who was initially sceptical about Spiritualists' psi abilities, attended a 
seance with the trance medium William Eglinton in Calcutta in 1882. Kellar was 
holding Eglinton's left hand and, as soon as the lights were switched off, 
I felt him rise slowly in the air and as I retained firm hold of his hand, I 
was pulled to my feet, and subsequently compelled to jump on a chair 
and then on the table in order to retain my hold of him. That his body 
did ascend into the air on that occasion ... there can be no doubt. 
(Kellar, 1893, p.78) 
Florence Marryat also reports on the entranced Eglinton's levitations: 
Indeed, I do not think I have ever sat with him at a seance during which 
he has not been levitated. I have seen him on several occasions rise, 
or be carried, into the air, so that his head touched the ceiling, and his 
feet were above the sitters' heads. (Marryat, (1891/1973, p.129) 
Fodor (1933/1966, p.388) collected the subjective experiences of various 
mediums while entering trances. Home claimed to feel dreamy and dizzy for a few 


--- Page 119 ---

110 
minutes before losing consciousness, whereas Eglinton describes feeling ecstatic. 
Leonore Piper claimed that something would make her brain go numb as if she was 
being etherised and she would then remember nothing until she awoke. To test the 
depth of her trances, researchers conducted experiments that today would probably 
not be sanctioned. A spoonful of salt was placed in her mouth to confirm that her 
lips and tongue were insensible to pain; strong ammonia was applied to her nostrils; 
an incision was made in her left wrist which did not bleed until she regained 
consciousness; a needle was suddenly pushed into her hand and a feather was 
inserted into her nose (p.389). Similar tests were done to check Indridason's 
trances. Needles were stuck "in several delicate spots in his body — in his hands, 
on the back of his neck, in the corner of his eyes and elsewhere - but he showed 
no reaction at all" (Gissurarson & Haraldsson, 1995, p.55). 
Researchers noted that changes in some medium's breathing were reminiscent of 
yoga breathing. "The trance as a rule, begins with hissing intakes of breath and 
ends with deep expirations" (Fodor (1933/1966, p.390). Emanuel Swedenborg 
(1688-1772) "believed that his powers were connected with a system of 
respiration. He said that in communing with the spirits he hardly breathed for half 
an hour at a time" (in Fodor, 1933/1966, p.390). The physician and psychical 
investigator, Baron Schrenck-Notzing (1862-1929) studied the mediumistic skills of 
the brothers Willi and Rudi Schneider. When in a trance, Rudi's breathing, which he 
could maintain for over an hour, was likened to a steam engine or a tyre being 
pumped up (in Fodor, 1933/1966, p.390), reaching between two and three 
hundred respirations per minute (Carrington, 1946/1973, p.55). Amazingly, 
doctors noted that Rudi's rapid breathing had no effect upon his body (p.55). The 
Baron reported that another of his subjects, Karl Weber (or Karl Kraus), levitated 
himself twenty-seven times using breathing exercises when not in a trance (in 
Fodor, 1933/1966, pp.201 & 337). 
Interviewee Garry claims to have levitated over twenty years ago when he was 23, 
before he became a Spiritualist. Because he had back pain, Garry visited a healer. 
I remember lying down on the table, face down, and after a bit of 
massage he put his left hand... where the head meets the neck, and 
the right hand on the base of the spine.... [The hands] weren't actually 
on my body; they were probably about two or three inches [5-7.5 cm] 
above. And, I felt something changing within the energy field, and it 
was probably within a minute or two that I noticed there was some 


--- Page 120 ---

Ill 
flowing going on internally in my physical body. And the only way I could 
describe it was like the blood flow I guess. Things started to rush. 
The healer held his hands over Garry for at least five minutes. "And as this rush 
was going on, my heart started to race faster and I noticed my breathing was 
starting to amplify". Garry's breathing involuntarily became faster and deeper: 
It all happened so fast, I can't tell you how long it took, but as the 
breathing got faster, so I felt the heart, and it got to a stage where it felt 
like ... when you finish a hundred metre sprint. And it was at that point 
that I started to rise off the table. 
It seemed to Garry that the energy rushing through his body caused his breathing 
and heartbeat to increase in unison until he levitated into the air. Because he was 
lying face-down he was able to estimate that he was "at least nine inches to a foot" 
[23-30 cm] above the table. Garry briefly looked sideways and saw that the healer 
had his hands in the same position and his eyes closed. He estimates that he 
remained in the air, still breathing heavily and feeling the energy rush through his 
body for about a minute. Then "I started to go down again. Slowly, very very slowly. 
And then, when I reached the table again ... everything started to drop off again. 
The breathing and the heart". After the session, Garry commented that he had an 
amazing experience but the healer said very little: "Just general pleasantries". The 
pain in Garry's back was relieved but not cured, and he never visited the healer 
again. All Garry knows about him is that he was in some sense a spirit medium: "he 
could see spirits and talk to spirits". It has not been possible to locate this healer to 
ask whether he deliberately levitated Garry or whether it was a side-effect of the 
energy that seemed to come from his hands. It is unclear whether this energy 
increased Garry's heart and breathing rate which in turn led to the levitation. If an 
increase in heart and breathing rates alone could cause levitation, there would be 
many more levitation reports than exist at present. Garry, who has a Catholic 
background, is now a Spiritualist and healer himself, although he does not claim 
that his levitation led him to these roles. Garry reports that "My grandfather was 
very psychic. [He] saw a lot of spirit[sj and he talked with them" which suggests 
that psi abilities could be culturally and/or genetically dependent. Some people are 
supposedly more sensitive to psi or healing energy than others. Dong and Raffill 
(1996, p.41) quote Dr Lu Wuwen, who claims to be able to use his chi to make 
opponents fly several metres backwards by waving his hand at them. Dr Lu says 
that there are four levels of sensitivity to chi. 
If the master sends chi from his hands at a person with high sensitivity, 
the target will be pushed back violently. Such a person can even be 
made to jump around when simply standing near a chi kung master 


--- Page 121 ---

112 
who is directing chi at someone else. A person of medium sensitivity 
will be pushed back by direct chi from the master, but not affected 
indirectly. One of low sensitivity will experience strong heart thumping, 
chest discomfort, or dizziness; and one of no sensitivity will not feel 
anything, although there may be internal injury. (Dong & Raffill, 1996, 
p.42) 
It is possible that Garry levitated partially as a result of his sensitivity to the energy 
that the healer was beaming at him. 
When interviewed, the spirit medium Oliver describes witnessing someone levitate 
while in a trance. In about 1995, a man in his thirties, who was interested in 
Spiritualism, was invited to attend a closed circle of seven people in Perth, where 
Oliver was the medium. As usual, they sat in a circle around a small table without 
touching each other. While watching the newcomer, Oliver opened with a prayer. 
"And all of a sudden his arms went out... and he just started to rise up, about a foot 
[30 cm] off the chair, and he stayed there... [he] didn't say anything." Oliver, who 
believes that spirits caused the levitation, says that the man was in a trance and 
"he didn't even know what he was doing". He remained in the air for about ten 
minutes while the others sat and watched in awe. Afterwards the man could not 
recall what had happened. Like demoniacs, this sort of amnesia often occurs to 
trance mediums after they come out of their ASCs. These examples clearly 
illustrate that for Spiritualists voluntary or involuntary ASCs and/or breathing are 
frequently essential for the production of psi phenomena. 
4.5 Alien Abductions 
ASCs feature in alien abductions and ufology in several ways, although there is no 
evidence that they are the result of breath training. As mentioned earlier, two of the 
basic theories to explain UFOs claim that they are either unconscious psychic 
projections (cosmic poltergeists), or that aliens originate from an otherworld that is 
accessible by ASCs. In Vallee's (1990b, p.216) UFO close encounter classification 
system, 'close encounters of the fourth kind' involve ASCs or "reality 
transformation" which covers "those anomalous reports with entities in the reality of 
the entities themselves. They include near-death experiences, religious miracles 
and visions, and many cases of out-of-body experiences". Similarly, Nick Pope 
(1997, p.261) claims that "There are certainly some compelling reasons to suppose 
that abductions do not take place entirely in our reality". In Vallee's opinion, "what 
takes place through close encounters with UFOs is control of human beliefs, [and] 


--- Page 122 ---

113 
control of the relationship between our consciousness and physical reality" (in 
Story, 2001, p.628). 
English ufologist Jenny Randies was one of the first to report that ASCs were 
frequently involved in UFO close encounters and coined the term the 'Oz Factor' 
(after The Wizard of Oz) to describe them. Randies (1988) notes the frequent rapid 
onset of the effect "which creates the impression of temporarily having left our 
material world and entered another dream-like place where magic rules" (p.23). 
She explains that the result of the effect is "a dreamy and weirdly silent state of 
mind that is recognised as peculiar by the baffled abductee, even though they do 
not appreciate what it implies" (p.22). Other ufologists acknowledge the existence 
of abductee ASCs but are equally baffled as to how and why they are induced. 
Cassirer (1994, p.205) claims that it is an open question whether we will be able to 
solve the problem "seeing that the phenomenon seems to hail from impenetrable 
dimensions of enchantment". In his study of the similarities between abductions 
and NDEs, Ring (1992, p.43) observes that "The onset of the encounter itself is 
often marked by an unusual alteration in consciousness — almost as though one 
has been swept up into some sort of a time-space warp where the ordinary 
boundaries of reality have been temporarily breached". In a similar vein, Mack 
(2000a, p.61) claims that "Those of us who work with abductees may ourselves be 
drawn towards an awareness of unseen realms of the infinite, in which the laws of 
space/time reality as we know them seem not to apply". Mack admits that it is 
hard for traditional science to investigate 'the subtle realms' that he believes are 
involved in the alien abduction phenomenon, because this aspect of reality involves 
phenomena that may manifest in the physical world but seem to 
originate in another dimension, to come from a place unseen. We are 
speaking of matters which are not readily observable under ordinary 
'separatist', dualistic scientific or methodological conditions, but make 
their presence known more subtly through an opening of 
consciousness or more receptive perception, (in Stacy, 1996, p.9) 
Randies (1988, p.222) suggests that, rather than "crossing the immense void of 
space in machines," advanced extraterrestrials "have harnessed the power of 
consciousness to cross the gulfs of space and seek out new life forms". In other 
words, she is suggesting that aliens have such an advanced understanding of 
consciousness and psi that they can enter and explore abductees' minds from 
within, which implies that human consciousness interfaces with a multi-dimensional 
realm that can be used for teleportation and a form of mind control or possession.

In so doing, aliens impose on abductees a confusing state of consciousness that, 
depending on their predisposition, may be interpreted in a positive or negative light. 
Some regard their encounters as visionary or spiritual experiences, while others 
interpret them as hallucinations or nightmares. These interpretations match ones 
from several of the other groups. Some regard psi phenomena as the work of 
independent spiritual entities, while others regard them as generated within the 
mind of the experiencer. For example, some claim (eg: Pope, 1997, p.253; 
Randies, Estes & Cone, 2000, p.299) that alien abductions are the result of sleep 
paralysis. Even if this is true in some cases, they are still examples of ASCs. Once 
again, it seems that we are unlikely to resolve this conflict until we learn more about 
the nature of human consciousness and/or Cassirer's dimensions of enchantment. 
As with spirit possession and Spiritualism, another ASC feature of abductions is 
amnesia. Because many abductees initially cannot remember their close 
encounters, some ufologists regard the experience of 'missing time' as an 
abduction symptom. For example/a person driving along an isolated road at night 
who sees a light in the sky and then gets home later than expected, may have 
undergone an abduction experience which ended with the equivalent of a post-
hypnotic suggestion to forget what has happened. In the early days of abduction 
research, hypnosis was used to find out whether episodes of missing time 
concealed abduction or contact experiences. This did not always work because, 
even when in a trance, some abductees displayed what seemed to be deliberately 
imposed memory blocks or were too frightened to proceed. Those who did recall an 
abduction experience were often able to provide detailed narratives of, for example, 
being floated up to a UFO where they underwent various medical-like procedures at 
the hands of alien beings. In his analysis of abduction narratives, the American 
folklorist Thomas Bullard (1987,1989) notes that they lack the typical fluidity of 
folk narratives and therefore concludes that they probably originated "in some kind 
of experience" (Bullard, 1991, p.l). Some sceptics claim that false memory 
syndrome is the most likely explanation for these bizarre narratives because 
hypnotists generate abduction memories by asking leading questions. This helps 
explain why abduction therapists today use the term 'regression' rather than 
hypnosis to describe their memory techniques. As Mary Rodwell (2002, p.98) 
explains, regression is merely a relaxed state during which "memories or dreams 
can be accessed more readily". Jacobs (1998, p.219), however, believes that 
conscious memories are not as reliable as those recovered by a competent 


--- Page 124 ---

115 
hypnotist, because some cases have revealed that aliens leave abductees with 
benign conscious memories of their encounters whereas deeper hypnotic probing 
reveals less pleasant experiences. Whichever perspective one adopts, this 
illustrates that ASCs are an integral part of the abduction phenomenon. 
My previous research (Harvey-Wilson, 2000) revealed numerous similarities 
between shamanic initiation experiences and alien close encounters. For example, 
some shamanic neophytes receive their initiation during dream experiences (Eliade, 
1951/1989, p.13) as do some abductees (Mack, 1995, p.405). Like shamans, 
many abductees claim to have developed psi abilities such as clairvoyance and 
healing, although others report having these abilities before their abduction 
experiences. This leads Basterfield and Thalbourne (2002, p.-lT) to suggest that 
"Perhaps, despite the anecdotal evidence, alien abductions are ... not 'psi-
conducive', but happen to people who are highly prone to psychic encounters 
anyway". Mack also found similarities between abductions and shamanism: 
The altered consciousness that abduction encounters bring about 
resembles in some ways the trance states of shamans, and like 
indigenous peoples, abductees are brought closer to a natural world 
that is alive with spirits of all kinds and is increasingly perceived as 
sacred. (Mack, 2000a, p.154) 
Many abductees regard the aliens they encounter as advanced spiritual beings who 
point out that humankind's emotional and spiritual limitations are perhaps 
irrevocably harming our planet. Like shamans, these abductees therefore advocate 
the environmental and humanitarian benefits of expanded spiritual awareness. 
Reflecting the suggestion that humans have a consciousness-reducing valve, some 
abductees point out that the aliens they encounter are much more conscious or 
aware than normal humans (Mack, 1995, p.208). This expanded consciousness 
may be why aliens seem to have such powerful psi abilities and could explain why 
abductees, who seem to be pulled into ASCs during their close encounters, develop 
similar powers. Mack's observations lead him to ask whether there is 
a shared, collective consciousness that operates beyond our individual 
consciousness? If there is a collective consciousness, how is it 
influenced, and what determines its content? Is UFO abduction a 
product of this shared consciousness? If, as in some cultures, 
consciousness pervades all elements of the universe, then what 
function do events like UFO abductions and various mystical 
experiences play in our psyches and in the rest of the cosmos? (Mack, 
1995, p.8)

Rebecca, who claims to have had a UFO close encounter, reports that in Alaska, 
when she was thirteen, 
I had been singing... for some two hours with four of my girlfriends 
around a campfire at a lake. I was quite high spiritually; it was like 
being one with God. There was Spirit and it was fluidic and I was a part 
of all. It was quite euphoric. Some would call it joy or bliss I believe. 
There came a point during this state in which this idea came into my 
head (while very much in trance) and I just stated that I was going to 
walk on water like Jesus did, and I headed for the water's edge which 
was some ten feet [3.05 m] away. I took three steps upon the top of 
the water and watched myself take those three steps; realized what I 
had done ... and sank. All four of my girlfriends at the time witnessed 
this; though in later years only one remembered. I dare say they were 
as high as I was spiritually; for it is my opinion that in that case as 
others, music, especially singing certain types of songs, raises one's 
vibratory levels... into altered states of consciousness. The three steps 
I took upon the top of the water didn't take much time; and, although I 
did watch my feet as they stepped, I don't remember the steps being 
slowed or quickened any more than just normal steps. I would say it 
was fun; I certainly wasn't frightened. (Personal communication, 10 
May 2003) 
Rebecca claims that she has been psychic all her life. 
I used to tell my mom bad things that were going to happen so she 
could stop them and she wouldn't listen to me, and then they 
happened, and then I would get blamed for making bad things happen. 
I could tell you what was behind cupboard doors, and words that other 
people were thinking would pop out at me in great big bold letters. 
Rebecca reports that "in my late twenties, early thirties" while married and living in 
Alaska, "maybe 3-4 times a year" her husband would wake her at night to point out 
that she was floating "some 3-4 inches [about 9 cm] off the bed". Initially he was 
horrified about her levitating, but eventually got used to it. "I had no conscious 
awareness till he would wake me that I was doing anything of that particular 
nature". Once woken, Rebecca would fall slowly onto the bed. She reports that she 
had a UFO close encounter in 1996, and claims to be able to heal. When asked 
what she believes causes levitation, Rebecca says that 
I don't think I would say that it is spirits that get us to levitate and that 
goes for any physically manifested phenomena. It occurs within us as 
the result of an altered state, even though some may be vulnerable to 
power from either side which could influence such things: ie: being 
helped along or assisted or, if from the dark side, quite possibly forced, 
if one were weak. (Personal communication, 10 May 2003) 
. Rebecca seems to have been born with psi abilities, which may account for her 
subsequent spiritual, shamanic and close encounter experiences, including 
levitation while asleep. Sleep can occasionally be regarded as an ASC. For 
example, some people claim to have clairvoyant or prophetic dreams (Fodor, 


--- Page 126 ---

1933/1966, p.107). Shamans may interact with "gods, spirits, and ancestral 
souls" (Eliade, 1951/1989, p.103) during dreams, and abduction experiences that 
occur during sleep (Mack, 1995, p.89) confuse abductees as to whether they were 
dreaming or not. 
Another example of sleeping levitation comes from Francis who is now a Catholic 
pastor, but says that when he was young he "dabbled a lot with the occult". He 
shared a house with a practising witch, did yoga, read New Age books and 
experienced astral travel. One night while lying on his bed "in the half asleep, half 
awake stage" and with a friend on an airbed in the same room, Francis heard 
voices and some beautiful music. His eyes were open, enabling him to see the full 
moon through the window, when some black shadows, that he had seen several 
times before, entered the room and said "There he is, let's get him". At that 
moment his friend woke up and saw that Francis was levitating "about half a metre 
or so off the bed". Francis was unaware that he was levitating and claims that, 
because of his occult indulgences, the shadows were demonic, although today 
some might claim they were aliens. Excited about the levitation, his friend took the 
reluctant Francis to a Spiritualist church because he obviously had "a gift of some 
sort". Francis has not levitated again, but, like Rebecca, he seems have innate psi 
abilities. He once prayed for someone who was dying from leukaemia and within 
two days the person was fully healed. If Francis does have healing abilities, it would 
match the claim — as discussed in the next chapter — that a significant number of 
levitators also have other psi abilities. 
4.6 Martial arts: Qigong 
Breathing and ASCs are an important feature of martial arts traditions such as 
qigong, although qigong breathing is also widely practised for health purposes (Pike, 
1980). Harish Johari (1989, p.7) reveals the connection between breathing and 
longevity. He claims that the scriptures of Swara Yoga assert that "the life span of a 
man is measured not in years but in number of breaths," so one's life span is 
increased by reducing one's breathing rate. Pike does not link psi abilities and 
breathing exercises, but points out that, to achieve success in the martial arts, one 
must use meditation to still the restless mind (p.136). When practitioners 
demonstrate the capacity to break bricks and pieces of wood, their power is 
"achieved by total concentration of mind, body and breath, concentrated upon the 


--- Page 127 ---

118 
single spot and the single thought until nothing else exists in the universe except 
the strike" (Pike, 1980, p.136). Dong and Raffill make a similar point; 
When we practice chi gong and enter a relaxed, meditative state, the 
rate of blood flow increases, the temperature rises, the breathing 
slows, the internal body feels as though a light electric current is 
flowing through it; it feels like stepping into a magnetic field, the body 
becomes light and seems to float. (Dong & Raffill, 1997, p.140) 
Dong and Raffill (1997) claim that qigong is one of the major sources of psi abilities 
because, among other things, practitioners learn to enter meditative states and 
attune their bodies to "the fields of the universe" (p.135). Meditation also assists in 
the accumulation of chi (Danaos, 2000; 2002; Dong & Raffill, 1996, p.vii) which, as 
a PK force, is used to throw combat opponents without touching them. Danaos 
(2002) also explains that meditation is a state of awareness between waking and 
sleeping that corresponds to theta brain patterns and that powerful meditators like 
his master can even access delta patterns. "A true immortal, like my master, can 
enter into a state of suspended animation wherein he will not need to draw a breath 
for eight continuous days" (p.122). 
Another reason why advanced martial arts practitioners train themselves to 
meditate more deeply and breathe less frequently is that it helps persuade their 
bodies to convert from using normal energy sources, including oxygen, to more 
universal or spiritual sources such as chi, which can provide vastly more power as 
well as psi abilities. As interviewee qigong instructor John explains, by breathing 
correctly using the diaphragm and the stomach muscles, practitioners gain access 
to more energy including chi, and the exercises are also "meant to open your 
acupuncture channels and meridians". With appropriate training this transpersonal 
power becomes more easily available all the time, not just during meditation. In 
other words, a true master may have permanent psi powers that a neophyte can 
only access during an ASC. Murphy (1992, p.449) quotes a famous Taoist precept: 
"Meditation in activity is a hundred, a thousand, a million times superior to 
meditation in repose. The stillness in stillness is not the real stillness; only when 
there is stillness in movement does the universal rhythm manifest". Qigong teacher 
Maurice claims that qigong can facilitate psi activities "because it's not our energy 
we use, we use the energy that comes from the universe through our bodies. So we 
are like a channel". Maurice believes that, by slowing their breathing, qigong 
practitioners are tuning into deeper levels of consciousness that are connected to 
chi and the paranormal or, as Bradley puts it, "you've got to be able to advance your 


--- Page 128 ---

119 
meditation, turn your senses inwards and look for the unseen things". Victor 
explains that in advanced meditation one must learn to remain still and empty in an 
effortless manner, "then you allow the external energy [chi] to come in". To avoid 
making the mistake of trying to be effortless, one simply concentrates on the 
breathing exercises in order to "let the energy carry you". 
Murphy and White (1978) reveal that many athletes, adventurers and martial arts 
practitioners admit to having experienced altered or mystical states of 
consciousness — described by some as being in 'the zone' — that produce 
exceptional or psi performances. Morihei Uyeshiba had such abilities. Aformer 
student explains that, when invited to attack Uyeshiba, he found himself flying 
backwards through the air as if he'd been thrown by a giant spring (in Murphy & 
White, 1978, p.99). Qigong teacher William describes seeing a similar 
demonstration in 1974, while studying aikido. A master instructed about six martial 
arts teachers to attack him as he crossed a room. They attempted to move towards 
him but, to William's amazement, although the master "didn't physically touch any 
one of them ... they were all [thrown] on their backs". Instead of walking across the 
room, William noticed that the master just glided along above the ground. The 
master claimed that his fighting abilities were of no consequence, but what was 
important to him was that "We were all sparks springing from a fire. He wanted 
union with that fire," which reveals that the master was a mystic. William points out 
that when teaching qigong he emphasizes that one must learn to harmonise mind, 
body and breath. "The mind is usually the worst of all,... it's a mad monkey for 
most people. So to cool it down, the practice of breathing is there". Similarly, 
qigong teacher Bernard claims that chi or prana can be moved "through the vehicle 
of the breath and ... through the vehicle of the mind". In his opinion, the ability to 
control and direct chi seems "to be a common theme that is used for people to get 
in touch with the paranormal powers". 
Qigong teacher Peter claims to have seen his Taoist qigong master levitate at a 
Chinese monastery in 1989. At that time, Peter, who was studying to become an 
ordained Taoist monk, was in the training hall with several other monks. The 
master, who was about 45 and had spent most of his life in the monastery, was 
seated at one end of the hall in the lotus position. "He moved from that still 
position straight up off the ground, very very slowly until he was approximately 10 to 
12 feet [3-3.5 m] off the ground". He spoke to the monks for about half an hour 


--- Page 129 ---

120 
while hovering in the air and then moved slowly down. Peter explains that although 
he was about 20 to 25 feet [6-7.6 m] away from the master, the hall's acoustics 
were good enough for the monks to hear him clearly, and they appeared to regard 
the levitation "as being completely natural and quite normal". When asked whether 
the master was in a trance while levitating, Peter explained that, because he was so 
spiritually advanced, the master was still able to speak while in a slight trance: "So I 
would say both his subconscious and his conscious mind was functioning fully at 
the time whilst this was actually happening". 
The American psychiatrist and psi researcher Dr Berthold Schwarz (1998) provides 
an account of the levitations of Joe Nuzum who is "An expert in the martial arts and, 
in particular, Ninja abilities" (p.32), a tradition which originated in Japan. Schwarz's 
article contains over thirty photographs of Nuzum levitating while in a meditative 
pose in his home in Washington, Pennsylvania, early in 1991. Two rolls of film were 
taken by Nuzum's partner Sandra and, according to the technician that developed 
them, there is no sign of double exposures and the negatives seem normal. In the 
pictures, Nuzum appears to be levitating about sixty centimetres above an 
armchair, with his hands clasped in front of him and his eyes raised upwards as if 
he is in a trance. In order to levitate, Nuzum told Schwarz (1998, p.38) that he sat 
down "and thought about levitation while he slowly went into a trancelike state". 
Although not a witness to the levitations, Schwarz has had prolonged contact with 
Nuzum and asserts that he is an honest person whose psi abilities, which have 
been developing since adolescence, should be the subject of further research. 
His paranormal demonstrations should also be carefully correlated with 
his detailed subjective accounts so that there can be better insights 
into how he puts himself into the necessary prerequisite trancelike 
states for levitation and his other psychic feats. (Schwarz, 1998, p.44) 
Schwarz explains that although Nuzum "is dyslexic (functional illiteracy), he is a whiz 
on the computer and his psi influenced the computer in many incredible ways" 
(Personal communication, July 2001). Nuzum's dyslexia may be related to his 
ability to enter ASCs and manifest psi powers. Perhaps his consciousness-filtering 
mechanism is not as rigid as most people's. For example, both Joseph of Cupertino 
and the Cure d'Ars had extraordinary psi abilities but were reported to be so 
scholastically inept that they were lucky to be accepted into the Church. The nature 
of some people's consciousness may enable them to develop psi powers much 
more easily than scholastic talents. The parapsychologist Dr Alexander Imich 
describes seeing Nuzum levitate in May 1997. Using an eight foot [2.4 m] red nylon 


--- Page 130 ---

121 
cord, Nuzum "formed an irregular, four-sided figure on the floor and then stood 
outside of the figure at one of the corners" (Imich & Ritch, 1997, p.92). Imich 
explains what he then witnessed: 
Standing approximately seven feet [2.15 m] away from him, he [Imich] 
has seen JN's [Joe Nuzum's] feet slowly leaving the floor, and rising to a 
height of six to seven inches [15-18 cm], then gliding in the air for a 
distance of three to four feet [0.9-1.2 m] and gently landing inside the 
roped figure. (Imich & Ritch, 1997, p.92) 
After the performance, Sandra Nuzum revealed that three days earlier, on her 
husband's fortieth birthday, he had levitated "in a semiconscious state" high 
enough for his head to be near their bedroom ceiling (Imich & Ritch, 1997, p.92). 
These examples illustrate the correlation between ASCs and extraordinary abilities 
such as levitation in the martial arts. 
4.7 Mysticism 
The mystical practices of almost all religions involve deliberately induced ASCs such 
as contemplation, meditation and prayers, which are often achieved using breathing 
techniques. Involuntary ASCs such as rapture or ecstasy also feature in the lives of 
many mystics. In comparing the levitations of mystics and mediums, Leroy (1928) 
writes that "With a few rather doubtful and therefore negligible exceptions, 
levitation never occurs in the cases of mystics outside ecstasy, and in those of 
mediums it is attended by a similar physiological condition called trance" (p.212). 
He also claims that one would find "in both cases common symptoms such as 
insensibility, low temperature in the extremities [and] slackening of the breath" 
(p.212). As perhaps the most famous Christian levitator, Joseph of Cupertino 
exemplifies the link between ASCs and psi abilities. Pastrovicchi gives numerous 
examples of his tendency to lapse into trances or ecstasies. 
At the age of eight he experienced his first ecstasies. When, at school, 
he would hear the organ or the songs the teacher practised with the 
more advanced scholars, he would let his book fall and remain 
immoveable with eyes raised to heaven and lips parted. Owing to this 
his companions called him 'bocca aperta', 'open mouth'. (Pastrovicchi, 
1918/1980, p.2) 
In adult life Joseph was an ascetic; he slept on bare boards, ate very little and 
"continually lacerated his body with a scourge studded with needles, pins, and star-
shaped pieces of steel" (Pastrovicchi, 1918/1980, p.14). Until ordered to stop the 
practice, he wore chains and pieces of metal strapped tightly around his body under 
his robes. Joseph would frequently lapse into ASCs: "The least thing pertaining to 
God sufficed to cause him to cry out and to lose the use of his senses" and, like 


--- Page 131 ---

122 
some spirit mediums, the depth of Joseph's trances was sorely tested by his 
colleagues: "when pricked with needles, struck with iron, burnt with a torch, or 
touched on the apple of the eye with the tips of the fingers, he did not move in the 
least" (Pastrovicchi, 1918/1980, p.29). Despite his insensibility to pain, Joseph 
could be brought out of his rapture by the command of his superiors. 
When enraptured, neither blows nor the application of fire could recall 
him to his senses, but if obedience called, he returned forthwith. On 
being asked one day to explain this, he replied that he did not hear the 
voice of his superior when enraptured, but because God loved 
obedience so well, and desired that he should obey without delay, He 
made the vision disappear at once. (Pastrovicch, 1918/1980, p.65) 
Almost all Joseph's levitations occurred while he was in a trance. Leroy (1928) 
reports that at Fossombrone Joseph hurled a lamb into the air and levitated after it 
to the height of the surrounding trees. "He remained thus in the air, kneeling, for 
more than two hours" (p.93). Shortly before Joseph's death, two doctors were 
cauterising his right leg when they realised that he was levitating above his chair. 
One of them, Francesco Pierpaoli reports, 
I had already begun cauterising, when I noticed that Father Joseph was 
rapt out of his senses; his arms were outspread, his eyes open and 
lifted to heaven. His mouth was wide open, his breathing had nearly 
stopped. I noticed that he was raised about a palm over the said chair, 
in the same position as before the rapture, (in Leroy, 1928, p.101) 
In Hinduism the term samadhi is used to describe the state of extreme 
concentration, trance, religious ecstasy, or divine intoxication, and, like Joseph, the 
Indian mystic Sri Ramakrishna (1836-1886) would frequently enter this state 
spontaneously. Once, while "completely intoxicated with divine love," Ramakrishna 
claimed that when a person has attained "Perfect Knowledge he sees only one 
Consciousness everywhere" (in Gupta, 1974, p.263), which implies that religious 
ecstasy enables mystics to bypass the mind's consciousness-filtering valve to enter 
a universal state of awareness. 
The Spanish Carmelite nun and mystic, St Teresa of Avila (1515-1582), was seen 
levitating while enraptured, which is classified as an ASC. Sister Anne of the 
Incarnation reported that once she observed Teresa, who was then her prioress, 
kneel to pray. 
As I was looking on, she was raised about half a yard [46 cm] from the 
ground without her feet touching it. At this I was terrified and she, for 
her part, was trembling all over. So I moved to where she was and I put 
my hands under her feet, over which I remained weeping for something 


--- Page 132 ---

123 
like half an hour while the ecstasy lasted. Then suddenly she sank 
down and rested on her feet, (in Thurston, 1952, p.12) 
Another levitating ecstatic was St Alphonsus Liguori (Leroy, 1928, p.112). On 
• several occasions while preaching Liguori was seen to levitate by the entire 
congregation. Brother Verdesca describes how in 1762, on entering Liguori's cell 
I saw him lifted two or three palms from his chair, in the position of a 
person half kneeling and half sitting. His arms were outstretched, his 
eyes open and lifted to heaven, his face was glowing and as it were 
transfigured.... His ecstasy lasted nearly a quarter of an hour, which to 
me did not seem to be long, (in Leroy, 1928, p.114) 
Sreenath Ciidlterjee (1887) describes a case of Buddhist levitation that combines 
breath control and trance that he witnessed at his home in India. He claims that 
one morning he found a Tibetan lama "at my door begging his food, after the 
custom of Buddhist religious mendicants, and liking his appearance, asked him to 
come in, and gave him food and lodging" (p.726). Just then, Chatterjee's milkman 
"a Bhootanese who spoke the Tibetan language, happened to call" (p.726). 
Through him as interpreter, I asked the Lama if he possessed any 
siddhis, or psychic powers. He enquired what phenomenon I should 
like to witness. I replied that it would be very instructive if I could see 
him rise into the air. He asked for a private room, called me in alone, 
shut the door, and drew the curtains before the window. Then stripping 
off his clothing to the languti, or breech-clout, he took his seat upon an 
asana, or small board, that I had placed for him. Crossing his legs upon 
the thighs, close to the body... he brought... his hands against the 
abdomen, sat erect, turned his eyes upward, and remained for a while 
motionless. His next action was to work his body with a wriggling 
motion, at the same time drawing several very deep breaths. After the 
third or fourth inhalation he seemed to retain the breath in his lungs, 
and for half an hour was as motionless as a statue of bronze. Then a 
succession of nervous shiverings ran through his body, lasting perhaps 
three minutes, after which he resumed his state of immobility for 
another half hour: his eyes all the while fixed as at first. His skin was 
free from perspiration and all signs of exhaustion; his chest did not rise 
and fall in the natural way of one breathing; his body did not seem 
stiffened but retained its normal suppleness.... Suddenly he, still 
retaining his sitting position, rose perpendicularly into the air to the 
height of, I should say, two cubits - one yard [1 m], and then floated, 
without a tremor or motion of a single muscle, like a cork in still water. 
His expression of face was placid in the extreme.... After I had regarded 
him in amazement for at least a couple of minutes, I thought to myself 
that that was quite enough to satisfy my curiosity, and I hoped he would 
not give himself any more trouble on my account. At once, as though 
my thought had been read, he gently descended to his place on the 
asana. He then emptied his lungs by three or four strong expirations, 
opened his eyes, stood up as easily and naturally as though he had 
done nothing extraordinary, and laughed upon noticing my signs of 
bewilderment. (Chatterjee, 1887, p.726) 


--- Page 133 ---

124 
The lama informed Chatterjee that "this sort of 'common-place Siddhi' could be 
performed by even Lama-pupils in his Guru's monastery who were not very far 
advanced" (p.727). He claimed that there were some adepts "who rise to the 
height of 15 feet [4.5 m] from the ground in their self-levitations" (p.728), which 
seems to imply that more training is required to levitate to this height. The yoga 
techniques taught at the monastery included "pranayam (training of the breath), the 
various asana (bodily postures), levitation, etc" (Chatterjee, 1887, p.727). 
The Sufi mystic Jalalu d'Din Rumi would sometimes levitate while in an ASC. 
Whenever he became deeply absorbed in prayer and devotion, he 
would rise from his seat and spin round like the Mevlevi dervishes, the 
order that he founded. And sometimes he would leave the ground 
altogether, rising up into the air. (Charles & Jordan, 1995, p.128) 
The German veterinarian, P. Muller, reports seeing something similar in Turkey, in 
July 1916 while attending a gathering of Rafai white-robed dervishes who were 
dancing in circles. After about an hour everything seemed to intensify and one of 
the dancers rushed into the middle of the circle. "And now the incomprehensible 
happened ... slowly the whole tense body of this man elevated itself about eighteen 
inches [45 cm] off the floor and remained there, floating in the air with the toes 
pointing down" (in Charles & Jordan, 1995, p.132). He remained in the air for 
about thirty seconds before slowly descending and then collapsing. 
Interviewee Alison, who claims to have levitated twice, provides another example of 
the connection between breathing and levitation. In about 1968 Alison was a 
twenty-five-year-old student of Hatha yoga in the Australian state of Victoria. She 
had been doing yoga classes twice a week for about three or four years. She 
reports that one evening "after a meditation and yoga class" the students were 
"going through a relaxation" while lying down. "The teacher was going through all 
the various parts of your body... the suggestion of relaxation as she went through 
them all". The relaxation exercise started upwards from the feet. Part of the 
exercise involved "relaxation breathing, just taking the breathing in through your 
nose, out through your mouth". This involved deep breathing to full lung capacity, 
holding the breath for about a second and then letting it out very slowly. "As she 
had gone through and we were... lying down ... at the end of it, there were no 
voices, no nothing. And then I just felt... [a] gentle floating sensation". Alison 
claims that "I just sort of went with the feeling, and let it go". Alison had her eyes 
closed and would not have been certain that she had levitated had her yoga

teacher, who was sitting up watching the students, not come up to her afterwards 
and said "Did you realise that you lifted from the mat?" Alison believes that she 
levitated while on her back for about five minutes and was no more than 20 
centimetres above her yoga mat. Rather than opening her eyes or panicking, she 
"just went with it because it just felt so good" and continued doing the breathing 
exercise. The only other feeling that Alison experienced during the levitation was 
"like an energy field, a warmth" from below her body. Her return to the mat was 
"quite gentle". Two or three months later, the yoga teacher, who had been watching 
Alison closely, noticed that she levitated again under the same circumstances. 
Alison says that she wasn't trying to levitate on either occasion but that it was "a 
lovely feeling" when it happened. Although her parents did not appear to have any 
psi abilities, Alison, who like Garry was raised as a Catholic, recalls that her 
grandmother, who was "part-Irish, part-Indian," sometimes seemed able to predict 
events. For about five years when she was younger Alison attended Spiritualist 
meetings with a girlfriend. There are some similarities which may be relevant to 
Garry and Alison's levitations. They were both breathing deeply and lying 
horizontally when it happened. Both seem to have an interest in spiritual matters 
and, rather than panicking, they allowed the levitation to happen and felt good 
about it. These similarities alone are unlikely to make someone levitate, so there 
are probably other relevant ASC components in these and other cases. 
4.8 
Summary 
This chapter has demonstrated that ASCs feature in all seven groups. The levitation 
examples reveal that ASCs and breathing exercises are closely connected to the 
development and use of psi abilities. A trained person can deliberately enter ASCs 
more easily, and those with advanced meditation experience seem able to access 
psi abilities while only in a light trance. For some people, breathing exercises help 
induce ASCs, while in others they seem irrelevant, which suggests that breath 
control is a natural and convenient way of entering ASCs, but that other techniques 
can also be used. What is not clear is why ASCs facilitate psi abilities whereas 
normal consciousness does not. One possibility is that ASCs help transcend the 
filtering system that supposedly lies between normal awareness and the expanded 
level of consciousness or spiritual realm where psi powers are available. However 
ASCs operate, it seems that levitation is almost impossible in a normal state of 
consciousness. The reports reveal a variety of levitation scenarios: people in ASCs 


--- Page 135 ---

126 
may levitate spontaneously or deliberately, while others seem to be levitated by 
shamans, fakirs, or perhaps spirits, but do not recall what happened to them. In 
Alison's case, although she can recall her two levitations, she is unaware of what 
caused them, but she was in a relaxed ASC and had been doing breathing 
exercises. 
In almost every levitation report the person leaves and returns to the ground slowly 
and safely. No explanation has been provided for this, but if some reports are 
fictitious, one might expect them sometimes to describe the levitator crashing to the 
ground. This suggests that these reports may be true and that whatever is causing 
the levitations is not just an unmediated, arbitrary power but represents, or is 
filtered through, some form of intelligence which monitors the welfare of the 
levitator. This mirrors the observations of poltergeist researchers who note that 
although flying household objects may be destructive and frightening, they seldom 
cause serious injury. Similarly, although Joseph of Cupertino was entranced while 
levitating, his aerial flights frequently followed a meaningful rather than random 
trajectory. Although not conclusive proof/these observations match the ancient 
mystical claim that consciousness, matter and energy are unified at a fundamental 
or transcendent level that is accessible by ASCs. Apart from the question of how psi 
abilities such as levitation may be possible, one of the most significant empirical 
issues raised by the apparent link between psi abilities and ASCs is whether 
consciousness is solely the product of the human brain or whether it can somehow 
transcend the physical body and access a universal consciousness or psi power. In 
other words, is the open or closed model of the mind correct? The beliefs of the 
seven groups, and the apparent link between breathing exercises, ASCs and 
levitation reports, suggest that the open model is more likely to be true.

Chapter 5 
Levitators' Other Paranormal Abilities 
The theme this chapter documents is that within all the groups there exists a wide 
range of psi abilities apart from levitation. Some levitators have numerous other psi 
talents, some possess just a few, while others appear to have none. It is not clear 
why these abilities are distributed unevenly. A brief review illustrates the range of 
psi abilities among the groups. By definition, all shamans have psi abilities such as 
healing and the capacity to communicate with spirits; some of them seem able to 
levitate and many have numerous other abilities. All spirit mediums, but not all 
Spiritualists, have psi abilities such as clairvoyance which supposedly enables them 
to communicate with spirits of the dead. Some physical mediums have more 
powerful PK abilities than others and a few sometimes levitate. Many demoniacs 
manifest a range of psi abilities, which sometimes includes levitation, and which 
normally ceases when they are exorcised. Poltergeist activity refers to numerous 
disturbing psi events which occasionally involve a person being thrown through the 
air. As with possession, the poltergeist problem is considered resolved or banished 
when the psi events stop, although some people learn to channel the energy into 
more productive enterprises such as healing. Some alien abductees claim to have 
developed psi abilities such as healing, and a small percentage of them levitate. 
Most qigong students have no psi abilities at first, but a few advanced practitioners 
seem to develop a large range of psi abilities including healing. Priests, monks and 
nuns from most religions are discouraged from using the psi abilities they may 
develop as a result of contemplation or meditation, but some advanced mystics are 
reported to have numerous powerful psi or miraculous abilities such as healing. 
As this list reveals, the groups have different attitudes towards psi abilities; some 
are seen as unpleasant and some are encouraged. Most shamans, spirit mediums 
and qigong practitioners view psi abilities in a positive manner, but demoniacs and 
those experiencing poltergeist activity would probably want all psi activity around 
them to cease, and many mystics seem ambivalent about psi events unless they 
can attribute them to a divine being. This raises the question of whether a psi event 
is the result of personal abilities, psi power flowing through a person from a spiritual 
source, or whether the event is the work of a discarnate entity. This chapter 
discusses levitators' other psi abilities, their nature and implications, and the next 
chapter discusses the various taboos that the groups have about psi abilities. 


--- Page 137 ---

128 
The claim that there exists a range of psi abilities in addition to human levitation 
can be interpreted in a number of ways. Sceptics might assert that because human 
levitation seriously challenges their beliefs, the assertion that some levitators have 
several other psi abilities is even more implausible. They might suggest that 
including these psi abilities in a study of levitation undermines the already 
precarious credibility that levitation reports have. This is perhaps a relevant point, 
but, given that this study has consistently criticized other researchers for ignoring 
psi reports that challenge their beliefs, it would be hypocritical to omit them from 
this research just because they are controversial. 
As well as a thematic comparison, this research is a hypothesis-generating exercise 
that seeks clues about how human levitation might work. If some levitators have 
other psi abilities, then a brief review of these abilities might help explain the nature 
of psi power in general, which in turn might provide additional information about 
levitation. It is possible that whatever causes levitation has no relationship to other 
psi abilities, but the evidence appears to suggest otherwise. For example, some 
people do not seem to develop just one psi ability, they tend to have several. 
Researchers have traditionally categorized psi into two groups, ESP and PK - or, to 
use the terminology of Spiritualism, mental or physical psi abilities. The 
parapsychologist Dr Michael Thalbourne (2001) points out that, until more is known 
about them, psi abilities should perhaps come under one heading because, for 
example, ESP may actually be the result of one mind psychokinetically affecting 
another. However one categorizes them, the anecdotal evidence suggests that 
there may be an undifferentiated power or intelligence behind people's psi abilities 
which can be focussed or channelled in a variety of ways. Joan Halifax supports the 
suggestion that spiritual energy exists in an undifferentiated form until it is 
channelled through the shaman. 
The initial call to power takes the shaman to the realm of chaos, the 
limen, where the cosmos is disorderly, where power moves freely — 
untransformed.... Only the practice of power allows for its mastery; and 
only through time and experience is the potentially damaging power 
safely manifested. (Halifax, 1982, p.9) 
There may be evolutionary or social reasons why certain psi abilities are more 
prevalent than others. For example, in indigenous societies a person who can 
levitate but not heal, communicate with spirits of the dead, or clairvoyantly find 
prey, would not be regarded as a genuine shaman, even though some shamans can 
also levitate. After their initiation experiences, shamans are effectively obliged to 


--- Page 138 ---

129 
develop socially useful psi abilities such as healing. In modern societies these 
social pressures do not exist, although my research (Harvey-Wilson, 2000) found 
that, like shamans, many alien abductees become healers. This may be because 
healing can provide a useful outlet for any chaotic psi power they may develop after 
their abductions, and it could reduce the ridicule they might experience when it 
becomes known that they believe they have been abducted by aliens. 
Almost all the psi abilities discussed in this chapter are anecdotal reports of 
spontaneous phenomena rather than from laboratory research, and 
parapsychologists would classify many of them as large-scale or macro-PK events. 
Cramer comments that researchers have 
realised that the type of paranormal manifestations one can test in the 
laboratory are of a different nature and character to those seen in real-
life situations. For this reason parapsychologists have distinguished 
between so-called 'lab psi' and spontaneous phenomena, the latter 
being of far greater intensity. (Cramer, 1979, p.228) 
The fact that reports of other psi abilities have originated from so many different 
cultures and religions suggests that they have some validity, although a sceptic 
might claim that this consistency is the result of people attempting to demonstrate 
that their gods are as powerful as those of their rivals. Nevertheless, as mentioned 
earlier, any scientific hypothesis about the nature of reality that cannot explain 
certain anomalies is obviously incomplete. These psi reports are therefore an 
invitation for further research. Another reason for discussing this range of psi 
abilities is that together they may provide a wider perspective on the nature of psi 
and its relationship to other forces in the world. For example, physicists 
investigating the reality of human levitation could ponder whether anti-gravity forces 
exist, but after reading a report where the levitating person also appeared to 
teleport, they might adopt a wider and more productive approach. The physicist 
Professor John Hasted (1981) suggests that there might be more than one 
explanation for the levitation of furniture and people. He writes that "there is the 
possibility of a continual rapid series of teleportation events, each to a position very 
slightly removed from its predecessor; this would produce the appearance of a 
continuous movement or suspension" (p.203). This does not explain how 
teleportation or levitation works, but Hasted could not have suggested that the two 
are connected if he had not read about both types of psi phenomena. The main psi 
abilities that this chapter discusses are teleportation, healing, radiance, fire 
invulnerability, interaction with animals and weather control.

5.1 Shamanism 
In indigenous societies a child may be apprenticed to a shaman because he or she 
seems to have innate visionary or psi abilities, while others only appear to develop 
these abilities after their initiation experiences. This raises the question of whether 
some psi abilities are genetic, which is discussed later. Shamans are people who 
seem to appreciate having as many powerful psi abilities as possible, although 
there do not exist many reports of shamans levitating. Journey into the Beyond 
(1392), filmed in 1984 by a German documentary crew, shows a shaman or witch-
doctor called Nana Owaka (or Dwaku) levitating in a remote village in Togo, West 
Africa. Quoting the film crew, Childress (1986, p.171) explains that, after agreeing 
to demonstrate his ability to levitate, the shaman meditated for a whole day before 
sitting in a circle of dried leaves and twigs. 
Just as the sun was setting, Owaka started to stir. A villager lit the 
circle of twigs and flames shot up. Drums began beating wildly —then 
we were hardly able to believe our eyes as Owaka stood and rose 
straight upwardl It was as if he were being lifted on a pillow of air. He 
simply hung as if suspended, with nothing above or below him. (in 
Childress, 1986, p.171) 
The crew filmed the levitation from two angles while Owaka remained in the air for 
about one minute before falling to the ground (p.171). The report does not mention 
whether Owaka demonstrated any other psi abilities, but as a shaman one can 
assume that he could also heal and communicate with spirits of the dead. It is also 
interesting to note that, like the Zulu shaman mentioned earlier who levitated a 
young man, Owaka had something burning near him when he levitated. 
There are numerous reports that describe the range of shamans' psi abilities. 
Australian Aboriginal shamans sometimes demonstrate their abilities to young 
initiates. In New South Wales in 1882, Joe Dagan demonstrated his fire immunity 
and then lay on the ground and sang silently to himself. 
As he sang, his magic cord came out of his body and rose in the air. 
Dagan then climbed the cord with his body in the same position as it 
was on the ground. When he got to the top, forty feet up [12.2 m], he 
waved to the people below. Then he sent his cord out and walked over 
to the next tree, and to the next. He came down the same way, like a 
spider on its thread, with his back to the ground. The cord then re-
entered his body. (Charles & Jordan, 1995, p.105) 
There are few other reports of shamans levitating this way. The cord may be a 
traditional technique, or something that Dagan materialised to make his levitation 
to such a height seem safer and less baffling.

131 
Writing about Penobscot shamanism, the American anthropologist Frank G. Speck 
(1919/1974) mentions numerous psi abilities including levitation: the "Penobscot 
shaman seems to have been purely a wonder worker whose magic power was 
derived from the spiritual and animal world. His chief activity was to overcome 
rivals and demonstrate wherever he could the superiority of his own strength" 
(p.243). Speck collected his list of Penobscot abilities "from myths in my collection 
of texts, from specific shaman anecdotes... and from direct tradition" (p.256), and 
points out that many of these skills were also attributed to neighbouring tribes. 
We find accordingly that shamans are accredited with the power to kill 
or injure creatures by pointing the finger at them, to prove their 
strength over rivals either in combat or in contest, to escape from their 
enemies by magic means, to spy on enemies, to imprint their footprints 
in hard surfaces, to increase or diminish their size, to spoil the luck of 
trappers and hunters, to cause thick ice to heave, to pass through 
barriers (doors and the like), to roll away a heavy rock, to lift themselves 
from the floor, to foresee the approach of strangers, to remain beneath 
water, to force rivals to throw off their animal disguises, to render 
themselves invisible, and so on. (Speck, 1919/1974, p.256) 
While it is unlikely that any one shaman possessed all these abilities, there exist 
reports of similar abilities in other parts of the world. In such a list the capacity to 
lift oneself from the floor seems fairly insignificant, which might explain the paucity 
of shamanic levitation reports. Compared with healing, levitation serves no social 
function other than to demonstrate one's prowess, hence Speck's (1919/1974) 
comments that shamans "frequently practised their art for amusement" (p.249). 
Speck provides an anecdote about Edmund Francis, a Penobscot shaman who died 
in 1914. 
He boasts, or they say that he did once, of being able to cross his legs 
on a chair and then lift himself from the floor by pulling up on the rungs 
of the chair. He tells that once he made camp on the banks of a 
distant stream. When he got ready to leave he started to jump across, 
the stream being quite wide. Half way over he remembered that he had 
left behind his axe and in mid-air turned about, grabbed the axe and 
finished his jump without alighting. (Speck, 1919/1974, p.267) 
Although no witnesses are mentioned, the fact that Francis claims to have picked 
up his axe suggests that, if true, this is an example of levitation rather than a 
visionary or out-of-body experience. Other psi abilities mentioned by Speck that 
seem related to levitation are the capacity to walk on water or to make other objects 
lighter. For example, being able to roll away a heavy rock probably involves mass 
control. Speck reports that one shaman supposedly had the "power to lift up and 
throw a boulder of great size" (1919/1974, p.265, footnote).

132 
Weather Control. Shamans probably learn to control the weather because, as with 
healing, it affects people's welfare and may even save lives. The most common 
example of shamanic weather control is the rain dance. As Eliade (1951/1989, 
p.304) writes "it is known that the [Paviotso] shaman can bring rain, halt the clouds, 
melt the ice of rivers, simply by singing or shaking a feather". Kalweit (1992, 
p.119), too, claims that "Hundreds of anecdotes about shamans influencing the 
weather are scattered in books, magazines and travel accounts". Referring to the 
yekamus [shamans] of the Yamana of Tierra del Fuego, Kalweit states that 
as various ethnographers assure us, the weather could be calmed as 
soon as a yekamus deigned to make use of his influence. In the 
loimayekamus, the Yamana school for medicine men, several medicine 
men always banded together to keep the weather favourable. When 
the... food supplies were menaced by storms, only the yekamus were 
able to avert the danger. (Kalweit, 1992, p.118) 
Vitebsky (1995, p.88) claims that the shamans in Nepal "lift one finger to make the 
snow fall and the other to make it stop... [and] can turn back a bolt of lightening 
even after it has set a house ablaze". Max Freedom Long (1954) discovered that 
traditional Hawaiian kahunas (shamans) control the weather by raising one's inner 
self to a higher level so that it becomes a High Self (p.356). Because all High 
Selves are linked, "an appeal for weather control can be made through one's own 
High Self, who, supposedly, passes it on to the High Self in charge of weather in that 
vicinity" (p.356). Long explains that N.S. Emerson, a surveyor who worked in 
isolated parts of Hawaii, made friends with a kahuna who "'introduced' him several 
times to the invisible 'god' (Aumakau) who controlled the weather, and taught him 
to recite a ritual prayer to cause the winds to increase or decrease" (p.357). 
Emerson retained this ability for the rest of his life. His friends would seek "his help 
in quietening the weather when they wished to go by ship between the islands" 
(Long, 1954, p.358). He was also invariably asked to attend an annual school kite 
day so he could call up winds for the large kites. Witnesses claimed that the winds 
would arrive within ten minutes of Emerson praying for them (Long, 1954, p.358). 
Despite the anthropological evidence about shamans controlling the weather, 
Kalweit (1992) complains that little serious research has been conducted into the 
subject: "Ethnology... must adopt the standards of the experimental sciences and 
make properly controlled investigations" (p.120). , 
Fire Invulnerability. Perhaps the most common examples of this ability are 
firewalking ceremonies. Shamans "are sometimes capable of handling fire-coals 


--- Page 142 ---

133 
without being burnt" (Drury, 1996, p.22), and Murphy (1992) writes that "Pavioso 
shamans of North America ... put burning embers in their mouths and touch red-hot 
irons" (p.467). In Halifax's opinion 
The shaman's mastery of fire is related to the mastery of ecstasy. The 
contact with conditions of excessive cold or extreme heat indicates that 
the shaman has gone beyond the ordinary human condition and is now 
participating in the sacred world. The rousing of mystical heat in order 
to achieve fire-mastery is common to mystics and shamans the world 
over. The ability to withstand the rigours of a winter waterfall or the 
heat of burning embers is a manifestation of biological and spiritual 
maturation. (Halifax, 1982, p.88) 
Generating internal heat is a biological function which can be controlled by yogic 
training (David-Neel, 1965, p.216), but withstanding temperatures that would 
normally burn skin appears to be a psi skill. Eliade (1951/1989, p.412) explains 
that 'inner heat' or 'mystical heat' refer to the psi capacity that ascetics, shamans, 
yogis and magicians may develop to perform miracles that transcend normal 
physical laws. If psi energy can create an insulating barrier around the body that is 
impervious to the flow of heat in either direction, then it could prevent a person 
from being burnt by hot coals, or the loss of body heat when sitting in the snow. 
Interaction with Animals. Interacting closely with animals is to be expected in 
indigenous societies, such as in the jungles of the Amazon, and the evidence 
suggests that many shamans can communicate with animals on a spiritual or psi 
level. Harner (1990) explains that some shamanic myths claim that in the past 
humans and animals were related and could communicate easily, but that over 
time that link has eroded: "While the mythical paradise of animal-human unity is 
lost in ordinary reality, it still remains accessible in nonordinary reality to the 
shaman and vision-seeker" (p.57). As mentioned earlier, Matthew Manning's PK 
abilities appear to derive from his limbic system, which can be regarded "as the old 
animal brain" (Manning & Rose, 1999, p.68). Manning quotes Whitton as saying 
that the psychic power coming from this part of his brain is "not a random gift, but 
an innate function and ability in the brain of homo sapiens, a function probably lost 
or defunct in most people for thousands of years" (p.68), which might explain why 
shamans — who are always seeking to maintain or strengthen their psi powers — 
develop such a close affinity with animals. Shamans often see birds as 
representative of the human soul; for example, Navaho mythology claims that after 
death the soul "assumes the form of an owl" (Saunders, 1995, p.51). During 


--- Page 143 ---

134 
ceremonies shamans frequently wear animal skins or costumes and some claim to 
be able to turn themselves into animals: 
the shaman can become a fish or a bird, a reindeer or a whale. In 
Amazonia, a shaman can become a jaguar by taking an exce^V.cnally 
large dose of viho snuff. When he dies the shaman may turn 
permanently into a jaguar. (Vitebsky, 1995, p.91) 
Harner (1990, p.58) explains that in North America a shaman's guardian spirit may 
be referred to as a 'power animal'. This spirit links the shaman "with the power of 
the animal world/the mammals, birds, fish, and other beings" (p.58). Animals may 
even manifest as humans when the shaman is in a shamanic state of 
consciousness (p.59). Eliade (1951/1989, p.460) notes that "imitating the gait of 
an animal or putting on its skin was acquiring a superhuman mode of being.... By 
becoming this mythical animal, man became something far greater and stronger 
than himself". A power animal may increase a shaman's physical energy, alertness, 
self confidence and ability to resist diseases (Harner, 1990, p.69). In environments 
where game may be scarce or hard to find, the shaman may use his or her 
clairvoyant abilities to locate them for the local hunters (Eliade, 1951/1989, 
p.459). Long (1954) reports that in Samoa the locals used to conduct ceremonies 
that summoned sharks and turtles from the deep into shallow water by 
communicating with the relevant High Selves (p.359). 
5.2 Spirit possession 
In many possession reports the demoniac manifests numerous psi abilities, 
including levitation, which may intensify during the exorcism ritual and then cease. 
Unlike shamans, whose abilities are generally voluntary, demoniacs' psi powers 
appear to be involuntary and often aggressive or harmful. Gordon (1996, p.162) 
and Rickard (1977, p.13) report the 1970s case of Sister Rosa, a possessed Italian 
nun who experienced an alarming range of psi events around at the time of her 
exorcism by Don Franco Bartolomiello. An iron bar detached itself from a door and 
seemed to teleport through walls into her cell and then started beating her as she 
slept. "Kitchen knives flew from a table to her cell and tried to stab her" (Gordon, 
1996, p.162). Don Franco reported that during the exorcism some string rose out 
of his pocket and twisted around Sister Rosa's neck as if it was trying to strangle 
her. On another occasion, 
on hearing screams from Sister Rosa's cell, [the sisters] rushed in to 
find her tearing at her cowl. When they removed it they found thorns 
from a cactus plant in their garden firmly embedded in her scalp. They 


--- Page 144 ---

135 
[the thorns] resisted all attempts to remove them until they were 
washed with Holy water. (Rickard, 1977, p.13) 
Rickard (1977) suggests that, as in some cases of poltergeist activity, these events 
were possibly being directed by Sister Rosa's unconscious mind: "We note that the 
thorns could have been a literal attempt to recreate Christ's 'Crown of Thorns', and 
the knife-attack Christ's 'ferita' or chest-wound" (p.13). He further notes that using 
physical objects "to reproduce the Stigmata is quite novel,... usually some kind of 
psychosomatic process forms Christ's wounds directly in the stigmatic's body 
tissues" (p.13). Rickard (1977) points out that "beatings and persecutions... are 
often stimulated by an obsessive meditation on the sufferings of Christ" (p.13). The 
most extraordinary event occurred when the convent sisters saw Sister Rosa "rise 
up in the air, float slowly up to the ceiling-and pass right through it" (Gordon, 
1996, p.162). Monsignor Remigio Ragonese, the Auxiliary Bishop of Rome, insists 
that the report is true and that the sisters found Sister Rosa standing on the floor 
above (p.162). In line with Rickard's comments, Sister Rosa's levitation and 
teleportation to the room might be symbolic of Christ's ascent to heaven. The fact 
that they blended together so well suggests that the same psi force controlled both. 
During their exorcisms, the bodies of some demoniacs undergo extraordinary 
physical changes. For example, Anna Ecklund's 
face became horribly disfigured and distorted, often suffusing with 
blood as her head swelled and elongated, her eyes bulged and her lips 
grew, reportedly, to the size of hands. Her abdomen would swell to the 
point of bursting, only to retract and become so hard and heavy that 
the iron bedstead would bend under the enormous weight. (Guiley, 
1989, p. 110) 
This seems to be excessive gravitation, and although the other symptoms may be 
largely psychosomatic, that does not explain what triggers them or why they do not 
produce permanent physical disfigurement. Another psi phenomenon that often 
occurs during exorcism rituals is that "waves of heat and cold pour over the room" 
(Guiley, 1989, p.87). A distinct chill may also be noticed in certain rooms in so-
called haunted houses, and Fodor (1933/1966, p.406) observes that "winds, 
breezes, currents of air, [and] cooling of temperature is a well observed seance 
room phenomenon" which "usually precedes and heralds strong physical 
phenomena". In experiments with a medium at the National Laboratory of Psychical 
Research, Harry Price discovered a connection between PK phenomena and a 
maximum temperature drop of about 10 C degrees (in Fodor (1933/1966, p.407), 
and Carrington (1946/1973, p.57) reports that the drop occurred within a few

136 
seconds. Peter Plesch (1999, p.217) calculates that the energy obtained from a 
drop of 10 C degrees in a volume of three cubic metres is equivalent to "the kinetic 
energy of an 80 kg object moving at 100 metres per second, which is equivalent to 
360 km per hour". This is easily enough energy to levitate a person, but, as Plesch 
notes, it does not explain the mechanism "whereby material is cooled below the 
temperature of its surroundings" or how the energy "could be converted to the 
directed motion of a flying object" (p.218). It does, however, support the suggestion 
that whatever lies behind psi phenomena links consciousness, matter and energy. 
Healing. Demoniacs are not reported to be able to heal people; instead one could 
say that during the exorcism they are being psychologically or spiritually healed 
either by the psi abilities of the exorcist, by divine power, by the departure of the 
possessing spirit, or they are unconsciously healing themselves with the power of 
their religious faith. The Catholic exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth claims that "Many 
times women have come to me before undergoing surgery for ovarian cysts. After 
the benediction, the pain stopped; a new sonogram showed the absence of any 
cyst, and surgery was cancelled" (in Chenery, 2004, p.16). He also claims "that his 
mentor, Father Candido, cured illnesses, including even medically verified brain 
tumours, simply with his blessing" (p.16). These claims illustrate the difficulty in 
verifying healing reports. While it is possible that an exorcist has innate healing 
abilities, other possible explanations are that the illnesses were psychosomatic, 
that they had gone into remission, or had been incorrectly diagnosed. 
Interaction with Animals. There are several references to animals in the 
literature on spirit possession, but not many about animal communication. One of 
the symptoms of demonic possession is that the person may make animal sounds 
and movements, which is reminiscent of shamanism. "Many medieval sufferers 
believed they were vicious animals, most often wolves. Some resorted to running 
on all fours and even tearing at their victims with their teeth. From such stories 
arose the myths of lycanthropy or werewolves" (Guiley, 1989, p.91). During his 
interview, Kevin, who is an Anglican priest, told how, when working in a country 
town, some men arrived at his church holding a woman who they claimed needed 
help because she was involved in witchcraft and had the spirit of a panther in her. 
When they let her out of the car, "she actually roared around the church grounds on 
all fours, roaring like a panther". Kevin was not sure what to do, "So I just said a 
prayer and she just flopped on the ground". Kevin did not see the woman again so 


--- Page 146 ---

137 
is not sure whether she was drugged, psychologically disturbed, or genuinely 
possessed by the spirit of a panther. 
Another symptom of possession is allotriophagy, which refers to vomiting bizarre 
substances or objects. In the Middle Ages this supposedly included the 
disgorgement of "anything from live animals, such as toads, snails, worms or 
butterflies, to pieces of iron, nails, small files, pins, needles, feathers, stones, cloth, 
shards of glass, hair, seaweed or foam" (Guiley, 1989, p.8). A modern collection of 
such objects (Chenery, 2004, p.16) includes a couple of small plastic dinosaurs, 
although it is possible that the possessed person(s) had previously swallowed them. 
In the Middle Ages some people alleged that their possession was the result of 
bewitchment by a witch's imp or familiar, which usually assumed the form of an 
animal such as a cat, toad, owl, mouse, or dog (Guiley, 1989, p. 121; Oldridge, 
2000, p.62). Others claimed "to be menaced by devilish apparitions in the form of 
animals" (Oldridge, 2000,142). Dr Susan Greenwood explains that 
The origin of ideas about familiars may lie in a belief in nature spirits — 
dwarves, elves, fairies etc — and, going farther back in time to our 
common shamanic heritage, to when shamans communicated with the 
spirits of the animals that their community was to hunt. (Greenwood, 
2002, p.100) 
Like shamans, witches were believed to be able to transform themselves and others 
into animals. They might do this to pass unnoticed, to torment people, or to fly to 
sabbats (Guiley, 1989, p.230). The devil was also often claimed to appear in 
animal form: "When Satan was mentioned by witnesses in witch trials he was often 
described as an animal" (Oldridge, 2000, p.59). Artistic representations of the devil 
frequently portray him as an animal, for example as a goat, with horns, a tail and 
cloven feet (Neret, 2003; Pickering, 1998, p.218). 
5.3 Poltergeist Activity 
Whether one believes that poltergeist activity is caused by spirits or projected PK 
energy from the unconscious mind, the phenomenon is largely defined by the 
occurrence of disturbing psi events and is considered resolved when they stop, or 
the PK energy is refocussed into a useful activity such as healing. The range of psi 
events that occur during poltergeist activity is probably as varied as in any of the 
other groups, although they frequently happen when no one is looking. For 
example, if a utensil flies across the kitchen, those in the room may be unsure 
whether it was thrown by a person or an invisible force, but, once normal causes 


--- Page 147 ---

138 
have been excluded, events that occur when no one is present are almost certainly 
the result of spirits or projected PK. Gauld and Cornell (1979, p.226) provide a list 
of the most common poltergeist events. Objects may move or fly through the air or 
seem to pass through walls or ceiling; people may be thrown around; raps, noises or 
voices may be heard; fires may start; pools of water may appear; electrical devices 
may malfunction; curtains or bedclothes may be disturbed; metal objects may be 
bent or broken; doors and windows may jam or open; writing may appear on walls; 
plants may be uprooted or damaged; and filth may be smeared around and 
offensive smells may occur. There often seems to be a human-like intelligence 
behind these events. For example, after returning to a locked house, small objects 
may be neatly arranged in a pattern on the floor, or a door will open when someone 
approaches. The English spirit medium, the Reverend Stainton Moses (1839-
1892), who sometimes levitated, would often find his bedroom belongings 
"arranged in the shape of a cross" (Fodor, 1933/1966, p.249). 
The poltergeist intelligence sometimes has a sense of humour or, as Colin Wilson 
(1981, p.146) notes, it acts like "a mad practical joker; the mentality seems to be 
that of an idiot child". The Black Monk of Pontefract case in the late 1960s in 
Yorkshire provides some examples. The family concerned were Jean and Joe 
Pritchard and their son Phillip (15) and daughter Diane (12). After the poltergeist 
had received some media publicity, Joe's sister Maude arrived, determined to show 
that there was a logical explanation to the activity. The family was mildly annoyed 
at her scepticism, and while they were all sitting in the kitchen, the room suddenly 
became cold, a familiar symptom that something was about to happen. The 
refrigerator door swung open and a "jug of milk floated out, sailed across the 
kitchen until it was poised above Aunt Maude's head, then tilted and slowly deluged 
her in milk" (Wilson, 1981, p.153). Later, while they were preparing for bed, Aunt 
Maude's fur gloves appeared around the door as if a huge invisible person was 
wearing them. Maude threw one of her boots at the door, but the gloves floated 
into the bedroom. One of them "clenched into a fist, and shook threateningly in 
Aunt Maude's direction who responded by bursting into 'Onward Christian Soldiers.' 
At this, the gloves began to conduct her singing, beating in time" (Wilson, 1981, 
p.155). Although this resembles human motivation, it could be caused by 
someone's unconscious mind or the spirit of a dead person. 


--- Page 148 ---

139 
Rogo (1990) gives an example where the poltergeist appears to respond to a 
challenge. In 1948 a Bavarian couple and their fourteen-year-old daughter "were 
bombarded by everything from stones to work tools as they lay in bed" (p.126). One 
day the mother 
collected all the poltergeist-teleported items, which had been scattered 
helter-skelter during a previous bombardment, and placed them in a 
toolbox. Then she sat on the box in defiance of the poltergeist. Yet, 
even as she did so, the same items... started dropping down from the 
ceiling, in front of her. They were soon scattered all over the floor. The 
witness thereupon opened the toolbox, only to find it empty. (Rogo, 
1990, p.126) 
If scientists ever learn how this sort of teleportation works it may revolutionise the 
world we live in. Matthew Manning reports that on one occasion 
I was collecting material for a Guy Fawkes fire at the bottom of our 
garden. Finding myself short of rubbish, except for half a dozen 
cardboard boxes, I went to the house and asked my mother what I 
could use. There was no one else at home and she had no idea or 
suggestion. I returned to the bottom of the garden, and to my utter 
amazement I found a stack of large logs and wood placed next to the 
cardboard boxes. (Manning, 1974, p.98) 
Manning, who thinks that the wood "materialized as a result of my wishing" (p.98), 
is a good example of a person whose childhood poltergeist experiences seemed to 
be the result of his own innate psi abilities. As mentioned earlier, Manning learnt to 
channel some of the poltergeist energy into automatic writing and drawing. Then, 
like a shaman, he directed it into healing, and is now one of England's leading 
healers (Manning, 1999), which supports the theory that poltergeist activity is 
unconsciously projected PK power. Psi healing is regarded as a form of PK, so 
Manning seems to have converted unconscious, chaotic PK into deliberate, 
focussed PK. Once again, this suggests that psi power is undifferentiated at its 
most fundamental level but, because of its consciousness component, can be 
deliberately focussed into specific abilities. 
5.4 Spiritualism 
Unlike spirit possession or poltergeist activity, spirit mediums generally welcome the 
development of voluntary or involuntary psi powers. There are numerous examples 
of powerful physical mediums displaying a range of PK abilities apart from 
levitation. According to Fodor (1933/1966, p.155) Mrs Agnes Guppy produced an 
enormous variety of apports during the hundreds of seances she held in London. 
Sitters would often ask for unusual objects to be materialised. Some of these were 
so large or bizarre and appeared in such abundance that it seems most unlikely 


--- Page 149 ---

140 
that Mrs Guppy could have produced them using sleight-of-hand. For example, 
when one sitter asked for a sunflower, "one six feet high with a mass of earth 
around the roots fell upon the table" (Fodor, 1933/1966, p.155). Other objects 
that appeared during her career as a medium were: twenty prickly cactus plants; 
stinging nettles; eels and lobsters; butterflies; showers of feathers; and on one 
occasion three duck carcasses ready for cooking (p.155). Apart from how this could 
be possible, one question is whether an apport such as the sunflower was 
materialized by spirits or invisibly teleported from someone's garden. Dong and 
Raffill (1997, p.151) give an example where, while testing the PK abilities of some 
Chinese 'super psychics', a researcher found that the materialized flower bud of a 
rare breed of tea plant had been teleported from his own garden. 
Mrs Guppy's teleportation occurred in June 1871 at a seance in the London house 
of the medium Charles Williams (Fodor, 1933/1966, p.392). The ten sitters did not 
include Mrs Guppy. Although it was light outside, the seance was held in darkness 
as a result of the doors and thick curtains being closed. When a sitter asked one of 
the spirit controls to apport them something, another jokingly said "I wish you would 
bring Mrs Guppy" (p.393). A while later there was a heavy bump on the table and a 
couple of screams. Fodor continues, 
A match was then struck, and there was Mrs Guppy on the table with 
the whole of the sitters seated round it closely packed together as they 
sat on commencement. Mrs Guppy appeared to be in a trance, and 
was perfectly motionless.... She had one arm over her eyes, and was 
arrayed in a loose morning gown with a pair of bedroom slippers on, 
and in a more or less decollete condition.... There was a pen in one 
hand, which was down by her side. From the first mention of bringing 
her to the time she was on the table three minutes did not elapse. 
(Fodor, 1933/1966, p.393) 
Mrs Guppy was rather upset at having arrived so poorly dressed, but the seance 
continued with her as an extra sitter. Afterwards, "Mr Harrison, editor of The 
Spiritualist, with three of the sitters offered to escort Mrs Guppy to her home" 
(Fodor, 1933/1966, p.393) which was "a distance of over three miles" [nearly five 
km] away. There they discovered that, before the incident, a friend "had been 
sitting with Mrs Guppy near the fire making up accounts when suddenly looking up 
she found that her companion had disappeared, leaving a slight haze near the 
ceiling." Mrs Guppy could not have entered the seance room without letting in 
some light, and a woman of her size could not have climbed onto the seance table 
in the dark without assistance. She was probably fully conscious while doing her 


--- Page 150 ---

141 
accounts, yet appeared at the seance in a trance, which suggests that the 
teleportation put her in an ASC, perhaps to enable her psi abilities to blend more 
efficiently with those of the medium and/or spirits that caused the event. 
As well as being the most famous levitating medium, Home also displayed a range 
of other psi abilities. Lord Adare, the Earl of Dunraven, who attended many of 
Home's seances, describes some psi events that he witnessed. On one occasion, 
while in a trance, Home, who often roamed around during his seances, put his 
hands on Adare's shoulders and, "I felt a strong current of heat flow out of his 
hands into my shoulders.... It was very hot indeed" (Adare, 1969, p.37). Although 
Home was not regarded as a healer, a sensation of heat is often experienced by 
people receiving psi healing. Home often underwent temporary physical elongation. 
Once, at a seance, Adare observed that Home, who was normally 5 foot 10 inches 
[1.78 m], grew to about 6 foot 4 or 6 inches [1.93 of 1.98 m]. Adare, who had an 
empirical approach, felt Home's feet to ensure that he was not levitating, 
whereupon Home unbuttoned his coat and Adare discovered that 
He was elongated from his waist upwards, there was a space of, I 
suppose, 4 inches [10 cm] between his waistcoat and the waistband of 
his trousers. He appeared to grow in breadth and size all over but there 
was no way of testing this. (Adare, 1969, p.38) 
Home could also elongate his arms. On another occasion, having put pencil marks 
on a wall to measure their length, Adare concluded that Home's total arm-span 
elongation was 9V2 inches [24 cm] (in Fodor, 1933/1966, p.124). At another 
seance, while lying on the floor, Home's elongated body was measured at 7 feet 
[2.13 m] long (p.124). If the human body can temporarily elongate to this extent, 
the anatomical complexity would be daunting, especially as Home could 
communicate and move around while it was happening. This suggests that 
whatever intelligence was mediating the elongation had access to relevant 
physiological information about the correct functioning of the body. This 
information would probably also be needed during psi healing. In technology terms, 
the processing of this information would probably require large amounts of 
computing power, quite apart from the biological precision of the PK involved. 
Home manifested numerous other psi abilities when in a trance; birds would be 
heard flying around the seance room, musical instruments would play by 
themselves, furniture would levitate, he seemed to speak other languages 
(xenoglossy) and he could make a glass of brandy lose its taste (Adare, 1969, p.41). 


--- Page 151 ---

142 
Some mediums are better at xenoglossy than others. Eric Post (1946) claims that, 
when in a trance, Miss Laura Edmunds was able to deliver messages "in thirteen 
languages, including Polish, Hindu, Greek and others. In a normal state she spoke 
only English and a little French" (p.117). 
During her interview, Maude, a spirit medium who claims to have levitated several 
times, reported that once while she was sitting in daylight in an open group of 
Spiritualists, the others "became quite concerned because they saw this light begin 
to glow around me and when they looked the chair was empty and I wasn't even 
there". The others then said protection prayers for the group and the church they 
were in and, "after a certain length of time, not immediately, I quietly and slowly 
came back". Maude, who was in a meditative state, was not aware that she had 
become invisible, which raises the question of whether people to whom this 
happens have ceased to be physically present or are merely invisible. No one from 
Maude's group felt to see if her body was there. American researcher Donna 
Higbee (1995) has published reports from several people who claim to have 
undergone temporary 'Involuntary Spontaneous Human Invisibility', but has not 
discovered what causes the phenomenon. 
Fire Invulnerability. Like some shamans, while in a trance Home often 
demonstrated the ability to resist being burnt. As Adare writes, 
Home went to the fire, poked up the coals, and putting his hand in, 
drew out a hot burning ember, about twice the size of an orange; this 
he carried about the room, as if to show it to the spirits, and then 
brought it to us; we all examined it. He then put it back in the fire and 
showed us his hands; they were not in the least blackened or scorched, 
neither did they smell of fire. (Adare, 1969, p.39) 
Home returned to the fireplace "then kneeling down, he placed his face right among 
burning coals, moving it about as though bathing in water" (p.39). Home could also 
briefly confer fire invulnerability on others. At the same seance, he picked up the 
large coal again and asked Adare to hold out his hand. 
I did so, and having made two rapid passes over my head, he placed 
the coal in it. I must have held it for half a minute, long enough to have 
burned my hand fearfully; the coal felt scarcely warm. Home then took 
it way". (Adare, 1969, p.39) 
One assumes that the passes over the head conferred the fire invulnerability, 
because another sitter who did not receive any passes burnt his finger when he 
touched the coal. Although he claims that the matter has not been seriously 


--- Page 152 ---

143 
researched, Inglis (1986) reports that in the 1880s it was shown that hypnosis 
"subjects put into a deep trance displayed heat resistance. If told that they were 
being touched with a pencil, they would show no sign either of pain or, later, of the 
effects of a burn" (p.168). Home could also confer fire invulnerability on inanimate 
objects. He once "placed a hot coal on his hostess's white muslin dress without 
harming it. Next he took some white flowers from a vase on the table and held 
them in the fire.... The flowers remained undamaged" (Gaddis, 1968, p.103). 
Radiance. One reason that seances are normally held in darkness is that they 
often feature luminous phenomena such as floating balls or stars of light. While 
"the medium was lying back, apparently insensible in an easy chair," Sir William 
Crookes (1874/1972, p.91) describes seeing "a solid self-luminous body, the size 
and nearly the shape of a turkey's egg, float noiselessly about the room". It was 
visible for ten minutes and hit the table three times "with a sound like that of a 
hard, solid body". Post (1946) claims that these lights "never illuminate the space 
surrounding them; they cast no shadows, brilliant as they may be" (p.91). Fodor 
(1933/1966, p.208) reports that "Solid objects afforded no obstacles to one's view 
of the lights. If they appeared under a mahogany table they could be seen from 
above just as well as if the top of the table had been composed of glass". 
Sometimes light was seen emanating from the body or head of a medium. 
"Tongues or jets of flame" (Adare, 1969, p.45) were once seen coming from Home's 
head, and on another occasion "he was elongated and raised in the air 
simultaneously, and the top of his head became quite luminous, giving the 
appearance of a halo" (Burton, 1948, p.195). Columns of light, luminous crosses 
and halos were also seen at Stainton Moses' seances (Fodor (1933/1966, p.208). 
Healing. The role of healing in Spiritualism has changed. In Victorian times, when 
seances were widespread, famous mediums such as Home were not seen as 
healers despite their astonishing PK abilities. Books that document Spiritualism in 
that era seldom mention healing (eg: Burton, 1948; Marryat, 1891/1973; Pearsall, 
1972; Post, 1946). This apparent disinterest in healing may have been because 
Spiritualism was an exciting novelty that supposedly revealed the existence of life-
after-death, thus perhaps reducing some people's concerns about mortality. In 
modern Spiritualism healing is important and several of the Spiritualists interviewed 
for this research work as healers. In her sociological study of Spiritualism, Vieda 
Skultans (1974) concludes that "Much of spiritualist activity is concerned with 


--- Page 153 ---

144 
healing and giving advice about sickness" (p.30), although she notes that 
Spiritualism "does not assert its supremacy over orthodox medicine. Spiritualists 
are seldom discouraged from seeing their doctor and they are rarely given advice 
which contradicts that of the doctor" (p.30). 
The English Spiritualist National Union (SNU, 2004a) has a Healing Committee and 
guidelines for those wishing to become spiritual healers. Whether they heal by the 
laying on of hands or praying from a distance, Spiritualists believe that healing 
powers come from spirits. Although there are many powerful spiritual healers 
worldwide, scientific validation is hampered by sceptical medical practitioners who 
claim that patients may not have been sick in the first place, or that the illness has 
gone into remission, or was psychosomatic. Nevertheless, of all the psi abilities 
possessed by Spiritualists and other levitators, healing is the most popular and 
comprehensively researched (Dossey, 1999; Krippner & Villoldo, 1986), and may 
pave the way to a more widespread acceptance of some psi powers. 
Interaction with animals. 
During his interview, the medium Oliver explained that 
a lady had once asked if he could communicate with her beloved dead dog. When 
he managed to do so, Oliver was amazed that the dog's spirit could provide him 
with information "that only she and the dog would know". His explanation is that 
they can "communicate with us because animals have a spirit exactly the same as 
we do". Other explanations are that Oliver was clairvoyantly accessing information 
about the dog from its owner, or that, if he was really interacting with the dog's 
spirit, his own mind was perhaps converting the dog's visual images into words. 
The Spiritualist literature has few references to animals, but Bentine (1981) 
provides the example of Eddie Partridge who ran a small grocer's shop in Dover. 
Partridge, who was born with psi abilities, was "barely literate" (p.72) but, after 
praying, always managed to get his accounts correct. He bred champion racing 
pigeons, was a spirit medium and an outstanding healer. One summer evening in 
1939, Partridge persuaded Bentine and his father to drive a few miles into a 
sheltered valley in the Kent countryside. He then led them to a small clearing in 
some woods. Standing in the moonlit silence, Eddie gestured for them to listen. 
Then he turned and, in a low voice, halfway between a whistle and a 
word, gave one strange, short, gentie call. Immediately, from every 
corner of the wood, the birds, the beasts, even the insects and, I felt, 
every tree and plant answered him!... There was no 'alarm' in that 


--- Page 154 ---

145 
spontaneous answer—just a massive response of nature to nature: 
like attracting like. (Bentine, 1981, p.80) 
This incident suggests that, like a shaman, Partridge could telepathically interact 
with animals, which probably explains why he was such a successful pigeon 
breeder. Although not a levitator, Partridge's psi abilities resemble those of Joseph 
of Cupertino. Both could easily communicate with animals and were almost 
illiterate, which suggests that when one aspect of a person's consciousness is less 
dominant, another part can more easily develop. 
5.5 Alien Abductions 
In what can be seen as the opposite of Partridge's joyous moonlight communication 
with nature, one aspect of the Oz Factor, which often occurs just prior to a UFO 
close encounter in the countryside, is that something resembling a 'cone of silence' 
seems to descend on the surrounding area (Bryan, 1995, p.68). This sudden and 
mysterious silencing of insects, frogs and birds is often what causes someone to 
look around and see a UFO in the vicinity. This suggests that some UFOs radiate an 
anomalous, possibly psi-related, energy field which the local wildlife can sense. 
As mentioned previously, it is unclear whether abductees are selected because they 
already have psi abilities or whether their close encounters bestow these abilities. 
It is possible that the ASCs abductees experience during their encounters can 
create or strengthen psi talents. On the other hand, if Home could so easily confer 
fire invincibility on his sitters, then perhaps aliens deliberately or inadvertently 
confer some of their psi abilities on abductees. After their encounters, some 
abductees experience poltergeist-like activity around them (Harvey-Wilson, 2000) 
which in indigenous societies would be seen as evidence of a link between the 
neophyte shaman and the spirit world. But it confuses many abductees because 
Western culture does not offer any similar explanations. Most of the PK incidents 
are minor, but some suggest an intelligence at work; for example, one abductee 
reported that her stereo would switch on in the middle of the night, play her 
favourite song and then turn itself off. In his comparison of NDEs and abductions, 
Ring (1992, p.156) adopts the term Electrical Sensitive Syndrome, based on 
Shallis' (1988, p.17) research into 'electrical sensitives'. Symptoms of the 
syndrome are that the psi or bioelectric energy that abductees seem to develop 
after their close encounters appears to interfere with electrical devices, especially if 
they are feeling agitated; for example, light bulbs and radios frequently malfunction, 


--- Page 155 ---

146 
computers crash and street lights go out.when abductees walk under them. These 
symptoms seem to reinforce the apparent connection between psi phenomena and 
electromagnetism. 
Healing. The majority of the abductees that I interviewed (Harvey-Wilson, 2000) 
have developed healing abilities, which mirrors Manning's transition from 
poltergeist activity to healing. Little research has been done to ascertain what 
percentage of abductees in other parts of the world have become healers and, if so, 
how effective their psi powers are. In addition to abductees developing healing 
skills, there is evidence that aliens have powerful healing abilities. Preston Dennett 
(1996a, 1996b) claims that a number of people who have experienced close 
encounters report that they were healed of ailments ranging from minor afflictions 
such as back pain or fever, to serious ones such as cancer or a heart condition. 
These claims cannot be verified without prior knowledge of who is going to be 
abducted, but if they are true, there are several possible explanations. Out of 
compassion aliens may use advanced medical techniques or psi abilities on sick 
abductees; they may be using humans as experimental medical subjects; or the 
cures may be the coincidental result of abductees being pulled into ASCs during 
their abductions. Given "that there are numerous similarities between shamanism 
and alien abductions, it may be relevant that in shamanism there exists the concept 
of initiation illness, in which a potential shaman suffers from a seemingly incurable 
aliment until he or she accepts the call to the shamanic vocation, whereupon the 
affliction rapidly heals. As Eliade (1951/1989) writes "the election of a shaman is 
manifested by a comparatively serious illness.... But the future shaman is cured in 
the end, with the help of the same spirits that will later become his tutelaries and 
helpers" (p.23). Perhaps the aliens involved in repeat abductions are the 
equivalent of tutelaries and helpers, especially as some abductee healers claim 
that various spirits, including aliens, assist them in their healing work. Some repeat 
abductees also claim to be part of an alien health-monitoring program in which they 
are told which foods to eat and which to avoid (Mack, 2000a , p.249). 
Interaction with animals. There are several animal connections in ufology. A few 
ufologists have even suggested that some UFOs are living animals propelled by PK 
energy (Gaddis, 1968, p.27). Alvin Lawson (2001, pp.35-49) classifies 
encountered aliens into six types: human, humanoid, animal, robot, exotic and 
apparitional. The animal category is rare and varies enormously; they normally 


--- Page 156 ---

147 
adopt an erect stance, have an unpleasant odour and communicate by growls or 
telepathy. The most common animal aliens are 'reptoids' or reptilians (Kottmeyer, 
2001b, pp.488-491). The few reptilians that are reported "are invariably bipedal 
with a human torso" (p.488) and some abductees claim to have had sexual 
encounters with them (p.490), which is reminiscent of traditional Christian reports 
of encounters with the devil, who was often portrayed in bipedal animal form. Some 
ufologists suggest that a few of these historical reports were actually alien 
encounters being interpreted in demonic terms. A few other aliens are described as 
resembling insects such as praying mantises (Jacobs, 1998, p.94). Mack (2000a) 
writes that "Deer, racoons, cats, panthers, owls, eagles, snakes, and spiders are 
among the animals that abductees have encountered in their experiences" (p.139), 
although, because the animal's eyes can seem too big, they may conclude "that 
another kind of being was represented in this particular form" (p.139). As an 
explanation for aliens appearing as animals, Bernado Peixoto, a South American 
shaman, anthropologist and abductee, states that "The beings seem to take a form 
that is familiar to human beings... perhaps the animal spirit with which the person 
is most connected" (in Mack, 2000a, p.140). In another apparent link to 
shamanism, most of the abductees that I interviewed report that since their close 
encounters they have developed an animistic perspective which includes a 
heightened sensitivity to animals and the environment (Harvey-Wilson, 2000). It is 
as if, like shamans, their consciousness has expanded so that they can now 
communicate telepathically with aliens, spirits and animals, including pets. 
Weather control. Apart from Dr Jeffrey Mishlove (2000), there is little evidence 
that abductees develop an ability to control the weather. Mishlove's book describes 
his research into the powers of Ted Owens (1920-1987) who claimed to be able to 
control the weather as a result of his ability to communicate with 'space 
intelligences'. Owens claimed that he levitated on several occasions. The first time 
was when he was four; he was playing outside when he "began to float up the side 
of the house, way up to the top of the house" (in Mishlove, 2000, p.45). The next 
occasion was at a country club swimming pool when he was thirteen. 
I climbed up on the ten-foot [3.05 m] board and did a swan dive up in 
the air, spreading my arms out. Then I didn't come down. I was so 
astounded and amazed I couldn't believe it, but I kept my arms 
outstretched and it was the most wonderful, exhilarating feeling I'd ever 
had in my life, (in Mishlove, 2000, p.45) 


--- Page 157 ---

148 
While climbing out of the pool a friend asked Owens how he had managed to stay in 
the air for so long. During World War II Owens was in the US Navy in the Pacific. 
One day I was outside on the ship's deck.... I climbed up on a hatch. 
There must have been fifty or sixty men up there, lying around looking 
at the ocean. I gave a little jump to go down two or three feet [61 or 91 
cm] off the hatch - and instead of coming down, I went up into the air 
and just sort of floated. All of the sailors were pointing and saying 'Look 
at that!' I was just floating and finally came down near the rail some 
distance away, (in Mishlove, 2000, p.48) 
Owens claimed that he was a repeat abductee and that his innate psi abilities were 
greatly enhanced after he encountered a UFO in Texas in 1955 (Mishlove, 2000, 
p.64). To test Owens' weather control ability, Mishlove asked him to document 
what he was going to do and the time period during which it would occur. Mishlove 
was well aware that Owens' claims would only be believable if the subsequent 
weather patterns were unusual, and on numerous occasions they were. Mishlove 
estimates that over a five year period Owens' predictions of dire events "including 
earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and violent events worldwide" (p.lll) were 
about 80% accurate. Because Owens was frequently angry that various authorities 
would not employ him to control the weather, he admitted that on several occasions 
he deliberately caused droughts or storms. In 1979 Owens said that he would 
direct a hurricane at Florida. Hurricane David formed in the Caribbean and headed 
towards the USA. A major disaster seemed inevitable, but, after Owens was 
persuaded to 'let go' of the hurricane, forecasters were baffled that, contrary to 
their expectations, David fizzled out (Mishlove, 2000, p.128). This is probably the 
largest form of PK ever investigated by a parapsychologist and reveals that psi 
abilities can be used for beneficial and destructive purposes. In December 1985, 
Owens told Mishlove that the space intelligences intended to destroy the space 
shuttle unless the next flight was cancelled, but Mishlove doubted the prediction. 
As he recalls, "However, a month later, on January, 1986,1 was shaken to my bones 
when the Challenger disaster occurred. The space shuttle exploded, killing all 
seven crew members" (Mishlove, 2000, p.226). Although this does not prove that 
aliens were involved in the Challenger disaster, it suggests that it is unwise to ignore 
the psi abilities of abductees like Owens. 
5.6 Martial Arts: Qigong 
Some advanced martial arts practitioners appear to develop psi abilities, such as 
extraordinary strength and the capacity to reduce or increase their weight. These 
abilities may blend indistinguishably with normal combat techniques, but some 


--- Page 158 ---

149 
exceptional masters have clearly observable PK powers. Morihei Uyeshiba was 
renowned for an ability which resembles teleportation. In a film taken of him in 
combat with two men he appears to turn and move about two feet [60 cm] away 
between two frames of the film (Murphy & White, 1978, p.100). As George Leonard 
reports, 
Those who were best acquainted with the Master are convinced that he 
was operating 'in another dimension', especially in his last years. Again 
and again he seems to have 'just disappeared', or to have created 'a 
warp in time and space'. (Leonard, 1975, p.253) 
Dong and Raffill (1996, p.28) explain that when qigong practitioners have learnt to 
focus their chi appropriately, contact with an opponent or a weapon the opponent is 
carrying will cause them to be "thrown to the ground as if feeling an electric shock". 
This 'empty force' can throw or injure a person from a distance, although it is 
unclear whether the energy is bioelectricity, psi power, or both. Long (1954, p.69) 
explains that traditional Hawaiian kahunas believed that the energy that they 
cultivated "had to do with all thought processes and bodily activity. It was the 
essence of life itself," which sounds like chi. The kahunas could hold "heavy 
wooden sticks in the hands and, by an effort of mind ... [cause] bodily electricity to 
enter a stick and charge it heavily" (p.69). This seems unlike electricity because dry 
wood is normally an insulator not a conductor. Long writes that 
These sticks were formerly used in battle, the kahunas standing in the 
rear lines, charging large sticks, and them throwing them at one of the 
enemy. Upon contact with the sticks, even the strongest warriors were 
often made unconscious. (Long, 1954, p.69) 
Long (1954) reports that the scientist Dr William Tufts Brigham tested these sticks 
and found that they could give a shock which "numbed the limb which was touched 
and made the head swim" (p.69). Long claims that "An early account in the 
[American] government archives tells how a medicine man exhibited his magic 
power by touching a strong brave on the chest with a forefinger, knocking him to the 
ground in an unconscious condition" (p.69). Similarly, Dong and Raffill (1996, p.29) 
describe the abilities of qigong master Wang Xiangzhai who, when challenged by a 
Japanese colonel, simply tossed him backwards without touching him. The colonel 
then challenged Wang to a knife fight, but "Wang just picked up a nearby stick. The 
... fearsome Japanese master was sent flying.... Still holding his knife, he was 
tossed up in the air and fell to earth several yards away". This form of chi may be 
the same energy that throws people and objects around in poltergeist activity.

Danaos (2000, p.22) points out that, by mixing yang and yin chi, advanced neikung 
practitioners can develop powerful abilities. As an engineer, Danaos always checks 
that he is not being tricked, and asserts that Master Chang's numerous psi abilities 
are genuine. For example, with no effort Chang is able to use the palm of his hand 
to push a chopstick through a plank of wood up to eight inches [20 cm] thick 
(Danaos, 2000, p.13). In San Francisco, Master Chang demonstrated his abilities 
to a local qigong master. He put two coins "in the centre of his palms and 
squeezed. He handed them back to the man folded in half" (p.96). When the man 
saw the folded coins, he was astounded. Chang then gave a razor to the qigong 
master "and asked him to cut him anywhere he liked. Try as he might, the man 
could not hurt John, even though ... he put all his power and emotion into it" (p.96). 
Apparently this was because, unlike Chang, the other man had only mastered yang 
but not yin chi (p.97) which can supposedly absorb other forms of energy. Master 
Chang claims that "When people walk on coals, it is yin ch'i that they are using.... 
Sometimes it is the yin of their own bodies, sometimes it is the yin ch'i of spirits. 
The yin absorbs the yang of the fire" (in Danaos, 2000, p.110). To demonstrate the 
absorbing power of yin chi, Master Chang gets a student to hold his hand over the 
muzzle of an air rifle while he puts the "first knuckle of his right index finger into the 
small of [the student's] back" (p.lll) to fill him with yin chi. After the rifle is fired, 
the pellet lies undamaged in the student's palm. Danaos checks that this is not 
sleight-of-hand by marking the lead pellets with a knife before they are fired. 
Master Chang explains (in Danaos, 2000, p.19) that he can transmit his chi power 
from the pyim of his hand in a shotgun effect, or from the tips of two fingers like a 
laser beam. To illustrate this he asked Danaos to choose a banana at random from 
a bowl of fruit, and then 
He extended the index and middle fingers of his right hand, folding the 
other two into the thumb. Tensing briefly, he passed his hand in a 
slicing motion about three inches [7.5 cm] away from the banana; there 
was an audible click, and half the fruit fell to the floor. (Danaos, 2000, 
p.19) 
Upon examination, Danaos noted that the end of the banana "was shiny, as if 
cleaved by a hot knife that had fused the surface... into a glassy mass" (p.19). 
Although it is not clear whether this is the same psi energy that Master Chang uses 
when levitating, it does seem that it is equally capable of transcending what 
scientists regard as the normal laws of physics.

151 
Healing. Because qigong is associated with health, longevity and the flow of chi 
within the body, advanced practitioners normally develop healing abilities along with 
their other psi talents. Dong (IP/84) claims that there exists an "inseparable 
relationship" (p.157) between qigong, psi abilities and acupuncture, because all 
three involve the flow of chi through the body. Dolic (2003, p.21) suggests that 
because aliens are reported to have numerous psi abilities, perhaps they are also 
great healers like qigong masters. As well as being able to levitate, Master Chang is 
a healer who supplements traditional acupuncture by passing his chi through the 
needles. Danaos (2000, p.6) claims that Chang has healed hundreds of people 
whom Western medicine cannot help. 
Interaction with animals. There are few documented examples of martial arts 
practitioners interacting paranormally with animals. Guiley (1991) reports that 
during a mid-life mystical experience, Morihei Uyeshiba's "mind and body became 
light. He understood the birds and became aware of 'the mind of God'" (p.345), 
which suggests that he had entered a pantheistic state of transpersonal 
consciousness which enabled him to commune with animals. Harrison (1955) 
provides an example of a master who demonstrated his psi ability by staring 
steadfastly at some sparrows in a pine tree and then uttered a kiai or 'spirit art' 
shout "whereupon the birds fell to the ground insensible. When he relaxed the kiai 
the birds regained consciousness and flew away" (p.169). Similarly, Kalweit (1992) 
describes how a Passamaquoddy shaman, prior to demonstrating his PK ability to 
leave footprints in hard ground, "emitted a bone-rattling cry that paralysed everyone 
present and made them unable to talk" (p.123). In linking animals and healing, 
Hariman (2003) explains that "The Five Animal Qigong" was developed as a result 
of the belief that "animals appear to possess a spontaneous self-healing capacity, 
which can be activated and systematically utilized through certain rituals and 
movements" (p.22). In a technique reminiscent of shamanism, by imitating the 
movements and assuming the personalities of certain animals, qigong practitioners 
can supposedly learn to heal various ailments within themselves. For example, the 
tiger relates to the lungs, and the crane to the heart and blood circulation (p.22). 
5.7 Mysticism 
A large number of psi events are reported around various mystics, some of which 
are well-documented as a result of the Catholic Church's investigation process 
before a person is canonised. Inedia is the ability to survive on little or no food for 


--- Page 161 ---

152 
longer than medical authorities consider possible. Theresa Neumann (1889-1962) 
was a stigmatic who survived for many years on just Communion wafers (Murphy, 
1992, p.503; Treece, 1993, p.180). She was investigated by the Church, but no 
evidence of fraud was found. At times she lost weight because of her considerable 
blood loss yet, without eating or drinking, her weight would return to normal a few 
days later (Murphy, 1992, p.504). In 2003, a team of doctors at Stirling hospital in 
I 
the western Indian city of Ahmedabad studied a mystic called Prahlad Jani, 76, who 
claims not to have eaten or drunk anything for 68 years. "Jani, who lives in a cave, 
says he was blessed by a goddess at the age of eight and ever since has received 
'the elixir of life from a hole in my palate'" ("Hermit", 2003). Jani was under 
observation (including video surveillance) for ten days in the hospital and "During 
that time he did not consume anything and 'neither did he pass urine or stool', 
according to the hospital's deputy superintendent, Dr Dinesh Desia" (Khanna, 
2003). One can hypothesise that, in addition to the air they breathe, some form of 
spiritual energy provides these mystics with the nourishment that ordinary people 
obtain from food and water. But how is this possible? Do all humans have a latent 
mechanism that is capable of tuning in to this energy? If so, why do so many people 
die of starvation? Perhaps, as with other psi phenomena, access to a transpersonal 
level of consciousness is required to switch on this mechanism. Along these lines, 
Murphy (1992) suggests that "the body has access to superordinary energies that 
can be triggered by religious passion.... Heroic fasting suggests that the body can 
reconstitute its elements in extraordinary ways, dramatically altering its habitual 
physiological activity" (p.505). 
Bilocation occurs when someone is seen in two places at once. In 1774 "St 
Alphonsus Maria de'Ligouri was seen at the bedside of the dying Pope Clement XIV, 
when in fact the saint was confined to his cell in a location four days' journey away" 
(Guiley, 1991, p.57). These reports suggest a connection between biolocation and 
teleportation. Some definitions of bilocation claim that, rather than being 
simultaneously in two places, the mystic merely transmits a vision to a distant 
location (Treece, 1993, p.307). But some reports confirm that the mystic was 
physically in both locations. The Hindu mystic Yogananada (1946/1983, p.26) 
describes how he once sat with Swami Pranabananda, waiting for a friend of his 
father's to arrive at the swami's apartment. On arrival the friend told Yogananada 
that he had just met the swami down by the Ganges and had been asked to come 
to his apartment. The friend asserted that he had held the swami's hand for part of 


--- Page 162 ---

153 
the half hour walk before the swami had gone ahead saying that he had another 
task to attend to. While sitting with the swami, Yogananada noticed that he had 
entered a meditative trance, during which time he had apparently clairvoyantly 
located the friend and then bilocated himself in order to invite him to his home. 
This report reveals a link between ASCs and psi, and suggests that science's current 
understanding of the relationship between matter, consciousness and space-time is 
seriously incomplete. 
Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1910), the founder of Christian Science, whose life has 
been well-documented, was a mystic with several psi abilities. As a child, when 
playing hide-the-thimble, she "could always go directly to the hidden thimble" 
wherever it was hidden (Braden, 1959, p.367). When Eddy was nine she used to 
hear voices calling her. When she eventually responded, "a curious lightness came 
over me.... It seemed to me I was being lifted off my little bed, and I put out my 
hands and caught its sides. From that time I never heard the voices. They ceased" 
(von Fettweis & Warneck, 1998, p.401). In later years she claimed that "her body 
was raised off the bed, to the height of perhaps a foot [30 cm]. Then she was 
returned gently to the bed. Three times the phenomenon occurred" (in Braden, 
1959, p.364). As an adult, Mrs Eddy was seen levitating by one of her secretaries, 
Calvin Frye, who 
states that on one occasion, when he went into Mrs Eddy's room 
suddenly, she was suspended in the air up near the ceiling. He was 
naturally astonished. She reassured him, bidding him not to be afraid, 
that she was quite all right. Then she quietly settled into her chair and 
all was normal, (in Braden, 1959, p.364) 
Radiance. Fodor (1933/1966, p.207) claims that "It is a well-known fact that 
religious enthusiasm and ecstasy in general is often accompanied by luminous 
phenomena" and Eliade (1951/1989) writes that "the 'inner light' that suddenly 
bursts forth after long efforts of concentration and meditation is well known in all 
religious traditions" (p.420). Hollenback states that 
One of the most common phenomena associated with mystical states 
of consciousness is a preternatural illumination that can take several 
different forms. Sometimes it becomes manifest as a brilliant aura that 
seems to emanate from either the mystic or the particular beings that 
the mystic encounters in the spiritual world. At other times it seems as 
though it is the whole environment that is suffused with radiance rather 
than the individual beings within it. (Hollenback, 1996, p.56) 


--- Page 163 ---

154 
Radiance or beams of light have been reported in conjunction with the levitation of 
several mystics. "St Ignatius Loyola was seen surrounded by a brilliant light while 
he prayed, and his body shone with light when he was levitated and StColumba was 
said to have been continually enveloped in a dazzling golden light" (Fodor, 
1933/1966, p.207). In 1745, while St Alphonsus Liguori was delivering a sermon 
at the cathedral in Foggia, a much venerated image of the Virgin "seemed to 
become luminous and throw a beam on the preacher's face" (Leroy, 1928, p.112). 
Liguori fell into ecstasy and "lifted in the air several palms above the platform, as if 
he was about to fly away" (p.112). Witnesses testified to a similar occurrence at 
Amalfi in 1756. As Alphonsus was preaching, an image of Mary near the pulpit 
appeared to light up and illuminate his face. The enraptured Alphonsus levitated 
for about five or six minutes (Leroy, 1928, p.113). In 1608, while visiting the Italian 
mystic St Bernadino Realino in his monastery, Tobias da Ponte saw so much light 
streaming out from his room that he thought there was a fire, but when he looked in 
he saw the saint radiating light while kneeling in prayer about 75 centimetres above 
the ground (Rogo, 1991, p.21). In a similar incident, a fellow priest saw the 
Spanish professor of divinity and priest Francis Suarez (1548-1617) kneeling in 
prayer about 90 centimetres off the ground before a crucifix from which a dazzling 
light appeared to be radiating onto his face and chest (Thurston, 1952, p.27). 
Both levitation and radiance seem to occur during religious rapture. Thurston 
(1952) reports that several witnesses described "the brilliant and supernatural light 
which had many times been seen to radiate from Father Bernadino's countenance 
while in prayer, though on these occasions he had not been raised from the ground" 
(p.24). Although most of these reports describe radiance emanating from the body 
of the mystic/there is sometimes confusion as to whether the light radiates from 
religious objects towards the mystic or vice versa. This is similar to the poltergeist 
activity controversy where it is suggested that a person's unconscious PK energy 
causes psi events to be directed at them, thus making them seem to be the target 
rather than the cause of these events. Similarly, the non-local psi power that 
mystics access during rapture may not only cause their bodies to radiate, but could 
also make objects shine light at them. 
Fire invulnerability. Several mystics are reported to have survived burning, but not 
always to their advantage. The Franciscan, Andrew of Spoleto, who went to Fez "to 
evangelise the Saracens" (Leroy, 1928, p.61), agreed to stand on a burning stake. 


--- Page 164 ---

155 
"Not only was he spared by the flames, but he was seen levitated in the midst of 
them, rapt in ecstasy. The Moors stoned him as a sorcerer" (p.61). In another 
incident, Colonel Jean Cavalier, the troop leader at the scene, confirmed that 
Claris, the Camisard leader during the rise of the Huguenots against 
Louis XIV of France, placed himself on top of a pyre in the presence of 
six hundred men, and in a state of religious fervour. He continued to 
speak as the flames rose above his head and did not stop until the 
wood was consumed. Not only was he unhurt, but there was no mark 
of fire on his clothes. (Gaddis, 1968, p.102) 
Joseph of Cupertino once appeared to bestow something similar to fire 
invulnerability on the Vicar-General of Nardo who, because of the hot weather, had 
been reluctant to bless three crosses that Joseph had erected near Grotella. The 
three and a half hour ceremony went ahead after Joseph said "My Mother will not 
let you feel the heat" and, although "the Vicar-General wore a cope, he did not feel 
the least discomfort from the broiling sun" (Pastrovicchi (1918/1980, p.55). In 
Naples, Joseph once levitated while in church and, flying in a vertical position with 
his hands outstretched, landed on the altar "in the middle of the flowers and 
candles which were burning in profusion" (Dingwall, 1947/1962, p.12). The nuns 
who were watching him called out that he would catch fire, but Joseph levitated 
back without suffering any harm. In an example of how ASCs confer psi abilities, 
the tenth-century Sufi, Abu'l-Adyan, once demonstrated that he could walk through 
fire without being injured, but developed a small blister on his foot. 
The Sufi later told his servant that he had received this blister at the 
instant that he was emerging from the fire when he prematurely came 
out of the trance-state that he had been in while crossing the hot coals. 
(Hollenback, 1996, p.193) 
Vincent Gaddis (1968) describes a fire performer who does not fit neatly into any of 
the seven groups but whose evidence seems relevant to this research. The 
performer's feats "included drinking boiling water, chewing glowing charcoal, 
handling and licking red-hot iron bars, and introducing a welding torch into his 
mouth repeatedly" (p.109). The climax of his act was holding and bending a heated 
iron bar between his teeth for about ten seconds. A dentist who examined his teeth 
and gums was unable to explain how they were not damaged. The performer 
explained that as an orphan in India he had been adopted by native fire-walkers 
who, although they could transfer their fire immunity to him, insisted that he must 
learn to gain the power himself. 


--- Page 165 ---

156 
For several hours each day he sat in front of a small oil lamp, trying to 
sense the god behind the flame.... Finally he became aware of a 
conscious something — invisible and intangible — connected with the 
flame, and in due time he received the gift of immunity. (Gaddis, 1968, 
p.110) 
Without disputing whether fire or weather gods exist, this example suggests that 
personifying whatever causes fire immunity or weather control makes it easier to 
attain these powers, especially if they have transcendent qualities, rather than 
originating entirely within the physical body. The fact that the boy had to 
concentrate or meditate on the flame for so long before sensing "a conscious 
something" appears to confirm that ASCs and psi powers are connected; that the 
"god behind the flame" may be a personification of a non-local energy; and that 
children may learn these abilities more easily than adults. 
Interaction with animals. Some mystics, such as St Francis of Assisi, are reported 
to have had a remarkable affinity with animals. If spirit mediums and shamans can 
communicate with spirits of the dead, it is not unlikely that mystics with psi abilities 
can communicate with animals. Joseph of Cupertino frequently displayed this 
ability (Pastrovicci, 1918/1980), as well being able to read people's minds, 
especially during confessions (Dingwall, 1947/1962, p.23). Joseph seemed to like 
birds; he once set free a gold-finch which returned when he called. A hawk, that 
had killed a finch that Joseph had taught to speak a few words, approached at his 
command and sat still while he reproached it. A ram that went mad after being 
bitten by dogs was healed when Joseph stroked it. He told two hares at Grottella 
not to go too far away for fear of hunters. When one was chased, it ran into the 
monastery and leaped into his arms. When pursued by hunting dogs, the other hid 
under Joseph's habit. When the hunters asked Joseph if he had seen the hare, he 
produced it and told it to enter some nearby bushes for safety. To their 
amazement, the hare did what it was told and the dogs did not chase it (Pastrovicci, 
1918/1980, pp.66-69). 
The Franciscan St Peter of Alcantara often levitated to a great height outdoors 
where he would remain in contemplation, on one occasion for three hours (Leroy, 
1928, p.63). Sometimes his body would be luminous, and in one report "with his 
arms crossed on his chest he continued to soar while hundreds of little birds 
gathered around him, making a most agreeable concert with their songs" (Melton, 
2001, p.909). Adam Dickey, one of Mary Baker Eddy's secretaries, tells how as a 


--- Page 166 ---

157 
child Eddy "learned that she could mentally address her pet dog and, without 
speaking aloud, get him to obey her directions. She had only to think, 'Ben, go 
under the table and lie down', to get the dog to do so" (in Braden, 1959, p.367). 
Weather control. Joseph of Cupertino seemed to control the weather on several 
occasions. He once prayed that the area of Cupertino "be spared in a severe storm, 
and the hurricane ceased at once" (Pastrovicchi, (1918/1980, p.41), and on 
another occasion, after praying during a frightening downpour, he ran out of the 
church shouting, whereupon the clouds dissipated (p.41). When he was 
"transferred to another Capuchin house in Fossombrone;... in the course of the 
journey it was observed that during a heavy shower Joseph's clothes remained dry" 
(Dingwall, 1947/1962, p.24). Mary Baker Eddy liked rain but not thunderstorms. 
In one of her notebooks she describes instantly changing some threatening clouds 
into gentle rain and a rainbow (Braden, 1959, p.365). After assigning her staff to 
keep an eye on the weather, her secretary Adam Dickey, observed that "there were 
fewer and fewer thunderstorms until they almost ceased altogether" (in Braden, 
1959, p.365). 
Healing. Joseph of Cupertino also seemed to have healing powers. "His charity 
towards the sick was... so pleasing to God that He glorified the saint by miraculous 
cures" (Pastrovicchi, 1918/1980, p.50). By acting as if they were merely the 
conduit for divine powers, mystics such as Joseph were able to heal people without 
jeopardising the Church's prohibition against vanity or egotism. For example, 
Joseph "once cured a blind woman by touching her eyes and saying'May the 
Mother of God restore you to health'" (Pastrovicchi, 1918/1980, p.55). On another 
occasion Joseph combined healing and levitation in what could be seen as a 
"seventeenth-century form of modern shock therapy" (Dingwall, 1947/1962, p. 18). 
When a disturbed nobleman was brought before him, Joseph touched his head, 
prayed, and then, uttering his usual cry of rapture, levitated into the air carrying the 
chevalier with him by the hair for about a quarter of an hour. When they returned to 
the ground, to the amazement of those present, the man was completely healed 
(Dingwall, 1947/1962, p.18; Pastrovicchi, 1918/1980, p.37). 
From childhood Mary Baker Eddy seemed to have extraordinary healing abilities. 
After her elder brother severely cut his leg, the wound would not heal until her 
father carried Mary into his room to touch his leg (Braden, 1959, p.367). As an 


--- Page 167 ---

158 
adult Eddy would heal people whenever she felt like it. She once healed a man in 
the street by touching his shoulder (p.366). She healed an engineer "whose eye 
had been put out by a hot cinder" (p.366), but the restored eye was smaller than 
the other, so Eddy treated him again, "and the eye became perfect as to size" 
(p.366). Once, in a furniture shop she was distracted by a clerk with a bandage 
over his eye. When he later removed the bandage, the clerk was baffled to find that 
the abscess on his eye had completely disappeared (Braden, 1959, p.366). 
5.8 Genetics 
It has been suggested that there is a genetic component to psi abilities. The 
literature seldom mentions whether the families of people described in this 
research also possessed psi talents, although, even if a majority of them did, it 
might be hard to differentiate clearly between genetic and cultural influences. 
Nevertheless, some evidence points to a genetic component, because some people 
manifest psi abilities when too young to have done much meditative or spiritual 
training. A brief review of the seven groups illustrates that this issue is still unclear. 
Eliade (1951/1989, p.13) points out that in parts of Asia "'self-made' shamans are 
considered less powerful than those who inherited the profession or who obeyed 
the 'call' of the gods and spirits". Similarly, in Western and Central Siberia 
shamanism is hereditary; "the future shaman exhibits exceptional traits from 
adolescence" (p.15). Vitebsky (1995) notes that although "most traditions 
emphasize that it is the spirits themselves who choose who is to become a 
shaman" (p.56), a shaman's "special powers may be inherent in a person from 
birth, in which case they must be brought to light; or else the person may have a 
predisposition or potential for shamanship and must somehow acquire the power" 
(p.54). 
There exist several examples of possessed children (eg: Cristiani, 1974), but I have 
not found any cases where parent and child were possessed. What might occur in 
child possession is that confused or malicious spirits invade the consciousness of 
unusually open children before they have learnt to prevent it. In the Enfield 
poltergeist case it was thought that Janet was a latent spirit medium who had not 
yet learnt to control her psi abilities, but neither hers nor Manning's parents 
seemed to have similar abilities. If psi abilities do have a genetic component, like 
recessive genes, they may only appear occasionally. Home's family background 
suggests that his abilities may have been inherited. Home (1863/1972, p.3) writes 


--- Page 168 ---

159 
that "My mother was a seer throughout her life.... She had what is known in 
Scotland as the second sight, and in many instances she saw things which were 
afterwards found to have occurred at a distance, just as she had described them". 
Burton (1948) concludes that "Daniel's mediumship was thus to some extent 
congenital and hereditary" (p.43). When Home was a baby his "cradle was 
frequently rocked, as if some kind guardian spirit was tending me in my slumbers" 
(Home, 1863/1972, p.l), and he had his first premonition when he was four. 
Many alien abductees report psi abilities when they were children but are unsure 
whether this was before or after their first close encounter experiences. Abduction 
narratives contain numerous descriptions of reproductive scenarios, aliens 
supposedly tampering with human genetics, and alien-human hybrid children 
(Mack, 1995, p.38), although it is unclear whether these incidents are related to psi 
abilities. In the 1957 Villas Boas case, he describes being obliged to have 
intercourse twice with an attractive human-like female alien (Story, 2001, p.633). 
Boas believes that he was being used as breeding stock, although he does not 
claim to have had psi abilities. In certain families, members of several generations 
describe abduction experiences (Wilson, 1998, pp.186 & 309), and some 
researchers (Carroll & Tober, 1999; Rodwell, 2000) believe that, as a result of alien 
genetic manipulation, there are numerous, what they term, 'Indigo' or 'Star' children 
being born with heightened spiritual, intellectual and psi abilities. There is some 
confusion about their function, but one suggestion is that they are here to help the 
human race become more spiritual and environmentally sensitive. For example, 
Mack (1995, p.333) suggests that "alien-human interaction is for the purpose of 
evolution, both biological and spiritual. A new breed or 'tribe', a hybrid form, is 
being created between the alien race or races and human beings". 
In the martial arts there is little evidence that psi abilities are inherited because in 
several traditions masters pass on their secretive techniques to their most talented 
pupils rather than their children. Master Chang belongs to a long lineage of 
masters, but the position was not passed down from father to son. One reason for 
this may be because advanced practitioners either become celibate, or severely 
curtail their sexual activities, in order to preserve and redirect their sexual energy. 
Mystics with powerful psi abilities are not noted for having equally talented children 
because their religions often require them to be celibate. Joseph of Cupertino first 


--- Page 169 ---

160 
lapsed into trances when he was at school which suggests an innate ability, but 
although several members of his extended family belonged to the Catholic Church, 
they are not reported to have had any of his psi abilities. 
During my interviews with Spiritualists they were asked if they believed that psi 
abilities were inherited. Although some admitted that several members of their 
families had these talents, most were unsure whether they were inherited, but were 
certain that family or cultural influences did make a difference. For example, 
although Maude claims that her parents, brothers, children and some of her 
grandchildren have psi abilities, she, Marianne, Richard and Edward think that 
everyone potentially has them but one needs to be raised in an encouraging 
environment for them to blossom. Similarly, Elizabeth, whose grandmother, mother 
and both daughters have psi abilities, suggests that "perhaps our minds are left 
open because of being brought up not to be afraid of things we can't see". 
There is no clear evidence that all psi abilities are inherited, although many people 
are born into families where several generations have them. Murphy (1992) 
speculates that evolution will lead to psi abilities becoming more prevalent. Apart 
from possible alien or genetic intervention, is not clear how this might happen in the 
light of the numerous taboos against psi abilities and research. Despite the 
antagonism of many scientists, Sheldrake (1981) has suggested that inherited 
traits are not entirely the result of biological genetics but may be influenced by 
information fields that somehow transcend the physical body. If there is any truth 
to these claims, then these 'morphogenic fields' may also be related to psi abilities. 
5.9 Summary 
This chapter has revealed that there are people with similar psi abilities in all the 
groups, and that some accomplished levitators, such as Home and Joseph of 
Cupertino, possessed a remarkable range of PK abilities. This demonstrates that 
levitation is only one among many unexplained psi events that occur worldwide in a 
variety of religious and physical environments. These psi abilities may be unrelated, 
but they sometimes occur simultaneously (eg: teleportation and levitation), and 
most group members assume that they are all facilitated by spiritual entities or 
powers. If they are manifestations of the same underlying force, learning how any 
other psi ability works may help explain levitation. There may be a genetic 
component and there seems to be a complex intelligence behind many of these psi 


--- Page 170 ---

161 
abilities. In poltergeist activity and spirit possession the motivation can be puerile 
or malicious which supports the suggested link to the unconscious mind of 
conflicted or immature individuals. Additional evidence for this background 
intelligence is that some levitators fly a meaningful trajectory and normally land 
safely; unlike modern surgery or medicines, psi healing cures illnesses, but seems 
to leave the rest of the body unscathed; people undergoing physical elongation 
revert to their normal size without damaged organs or bones; and people can 
bilocate or be teleported without suffering psychological or physical damage. As the 
report of the orphan who accessed the god behind the flame illustrates (Gaddis, 
1968, p.110), psi abilities are not only linked to consciousness, but appear to have 
functional access to all levels of matter, which appears to support the traditional 
yogic or mystical assertion that some aspect of consciousness underlies physical 
reality. In addition, the fact that some mystics can learn to survive without eating 
and drinking suggests that psi energy and chi may be synonymous; a non-local form 
of energy that already permeates the body whether one has learnt to control it or 
not.

Chapter 6 
Taboos and Obstacles 
The theme of this chapter is that the seven groups that have traditionally produced 
levitation reports have a variety of internal and/or external restrictions, obstacles or 
sanctions that impede the personal development, public demonstration, or 
empirical investigation of psi phenomena. For convenience, I will use the term 
'taboo' when discussing these restrictions, although this is an extension of the 
word's normal anthropological meaning. The word taboo "derives from the 
Polynesian tabu or tapu meaning 'sacred'" and "refers to an exceptionally powerful 
prohibition norm whose violation by individuals usually attracts strong sanctions 
from the community" (Hunter and Whitten, 1976, p.379). Winick (1970) claims 
that "in the early study of religion, the term taboo was used to indicate the signs of 
caution established to guard against basically dangerous things" (p.523). 
Were it not for the existence of these obstacles and taboos over the centuries, 
human levitation would today probably have a very different cultural, religious and 
scientific status. As a result of these taboos and obstacles, in modern Western 
society there are very few public demonstrations of levitation, and few people are 
sufficiently convinced of the reality of such PK events to consider researching them. 
For example, there are currently no parapsychologists or psi research units in any of 
the five universities in Western Australia, and I have not found a researcher 
anywhere in the world who is studying human levitation. As George Hansen (2001) 
notes, the entertainment industry has made millions out of popular films about the 
paranormal and aliens, such as The Exorcist (1973), £7(1982) and The Sixth Sense 
(1999), yet the amount of money that has been spent on scientific research into 
these subjects is negligible. 
Some of the taboos to be discussed are not limited to any particular group but, 
especially in Western society, reflect wider social, religious, or scientific attitudes 
about psi or miraculous events. Some of the taboos have varied over time; a few of 
the older ones are now less powerful, while others have arisen more recently. Even 
if these taboos weakened, and the seven groups started vigorously claiming that a 
few of their members had levitated, they may still not be believed by the wider 
community. Radin says that one reason for this is the four-stage process that new 
or radical ideas have to go through to be accepted by science. 


--- Page 172 ---

163 
In Stage 1, skeptics confidently proclaim that the idea is impossible 
because it violates the Laws of Science. This stage can last for years or 
centuries, depending on how much the idea challenges conventional 
wisdom. In Stage 2, skeptics reluctantly concede that the idea is 
possible but that it is not very interesting and the claimed effects are 
extremely weak. Stage 3 begins when the mainstream realises not only 
that the idea is important but that its effects are much stronger and 
more pervasive than previously imagined. Stage 4 is achieved when 
the same critics who previously disavowed any interest in the idea 
begin to proclaim that they thought of it first. Eventually, no one 
remembers that the idea was once considered a dangerous heresy. 
(Radin, 1997, p.l) 
Not all new ideas receive this treatment, but it would appear that with regard to 
human levitation some researchers are still at the equivalent of Stage 1. For 
example, Dr Robert Carroll's The Skeptics Dictionary (2003) states that "Some take 
the ability to levitate as [a] sign of blessedness. Others see levitation as a 
conjuror's trick. No one really levitates; they just appear to do so." Dr Carroll has 
chaired the philosophy department of an American college for several years and 
teaches classes such as 'Logic and Critical Reasoning' and 'Critical Thinking About 
the Paranormal and the Occult'. Asserting, without providing any supporting 
. 
evidence, that no one levitates illustrates the inadequate reasoning that many 
sceptics use to justify their antagonism towards the paranormal. 
Hansen (2001) claims that in the USA the "Committee for the Scientific 
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal [CSICOP]... is the most aggressive 
antagonist of the paranormal today" (p.148). Likewise, Eysenck & Sargent (1993) 
explain that CSICOP has "had a baneful effect on parapsychology and retarded its 
development" (p.178), and Radin (1997, p.217) notes "its impassioned 
commitment against parapsychology". Hansen (2001) points out that the group's 
magazine The Skeptical Inquirer has a circulation of over fifty thousand, while the 
circulation of the Journal of Parapsychology is less than eight hundred (p.148). 
CSICOP "has spawned more than 65 local and international groups with similar 
aims" (p.148). Hansen (2001) quotes Lee Nisbet, a previous Executive Director of 
CSICOP, as saying that belief in the paranormal is "a very dangerous phenomenon, 
dangerous to science, dangerous to the basic fabric of our society.... We feel it is 
the duty of the scientific community to show that these beliefs are utterly screwball" 
(p.149). Hansen notes that the committee includes many well-qualified members, 
is dominated by males, is largely against religious sentiments and includes 
numerous magicians (p.149). He explains that 


--- Page 173 ---

164 
wariness towards the supernatural is nothing new for humankind; it 
goes back millennia. There have always been taboos, prohibitions, and 
restrictions surrounding the supernatural. There are undoubtedly good 
reasons for this. Religious orthodoxy decrees dabbling in the 
paranormal to be a sin; CSICOP ridicules such dabbling. The effect is 
the same. Both religious orthodoxy and atheists enforce a taboo; both 
shun paranormal phenomena, and this commonality is key to 
understanding them. (Hansen, 2001, p.161) 
The scrutiny of groups such as CSICOP does have some benefits, as Cambridge 
physicist Professor Brian Josephson explains: "If anything the (parapsychology) 
research is of a higher standard because people are aware of the importance of not 
doing research in a way that the sceptics can criticise" (in Macgregor, 2002, p.ll). 
Scepticism is not limited to America. Jayashree Lengade (2002) reports that in 
India the Bombay (Mumbai) police and a group called the All India Committee to 
Eradicate Superstition and Blind Faith are "cracking down on charlatans" by 
attempting "to convince people [that] special power is more often than not sleight of 
hand or illusion" (p.9). The group attempts to expose tricksters, who extract money 
from the public by pretending to be 'godmen' with psi powers, by using stage 
magicians to demonstrate how magical tricks are performed. In one demonstration, 
a man is clad in saffron robes and wearing a false beard and seems to 
sit suspended in mid-air without any support but for a hand resting on a 
pole. But a superstition-busting activist tells the hushed crowd of more 
than 100 people that the long garment actually hides a wooden seat 
fixed to the pole. (Lengade, 2002, p.9) 
It is appropriate to expos.e fraudulent behaviour, but this group's activities seem to 
imply that psi phenomena such as levitation do not exist at all. Campaign magician 
Anand Tayade claims that "There's no such thing as performing miracles on this 
earth" (in Lengade, 2002, p.9). Given that no conclusive scientific evidence has 
proven that miracles or psi phenomena do not exist, this group's assertions appear 
to be somewhat misleading. 
Another, perhaps unexpected, source of scepticism about miraculous events is 
some members of the Christian Church itself. The Anglican Dean of Perth, Dr John 
Shepherd (2003, p.4), asserts that biblical miracles are merely "stories which 
symbolise Christ's affinity with the Father," so need not be regarded as actual 
occurrences. "Hardly surprisingly, symbols need to be interpreted symbolically, not 
literally" (p.4). Similarly, Barbara Thiering (1992) claims that "In the gospels there 
are a great many miracles, which the modern mind finds incredible" (p.22). She 


--- Page 174 ---

165 
asserts that biblical miracles are "part of the surface story, but also conceal 
something else, actual historical events" (p.23). Thiering uses the pesher 
technique to discover what lies behind miracle stories. For example, she concludes 
that reports of Jesus walking on the water are actually a cryptic way of saying that 
he was walking along a pier that enabled priests to board boats without getting their 
robes wet (p.92). While this suggestion may be true, it leaves unanswered the 
question of whether we should interpret reports of miracles from other religions in a 
similar fashion, or whether some of them are descriptions of genuine psi events. 
Sceptical newspaper articles have a wider public influence than those in 
professional journals. In 2003 the Australian Federal Minister for Education, Dr 
Brendan Nelson, wanted "to cut funding for 'frivolous courses' like golf course 
management, aromatherapy, surfboard riding and the paranormal, to ensure that 
universities serve Australia's long-term interests" (Ruse, 2003). Nelson claimed 
that it was possible to do a degree in the paranormal (in Bridgstock, 2003). In an 
ironic twist, one person who responded vehemently was Dr Martin Bridgstock, a life 
member of the Australian Skeptics, who pointed out that his 'Skepticism, Science 
and the Paranormal' class is just an option in a BSc degree at Griffith University 
(Bridgstock, 2003). That this course is being taught by someone who is sceptical 
about psi illustrates science's attitude towards this subject. Although Bridgstock 
claims that he is not trying to turn his students into sceptics, it would be interesting 
to see how the Australian Skeptics would react if a firm believer in psi started 
teaching a course on the paranormal. 
As a possible explanation for the public scepticism of some scientists, it has been 
suggested that secret psi research by the superpowers commenced during the Cold 
War and remains classified (Gerber, 2001; White, 1988). This is currently almost 
impossible to prove and, if true, would only involve a minority of scientists, but their 
contrived public scepticism about psi might influence many other researchers. 
Hasted (1981) reports that in "1977 a young Russian physicist, Auguste Stern, 
defected to the West and related some of his experiences in parapsychology" 
(p.201). Stern claimed he had worked in the Siberian science city of Novosibirsk at 
an institute that had about fifty scientists in its parapsychology department. Hasted 
writes that the Soviets used the term 'partial death' to describe levitation, "a term 
which indicates a rather different conceptual approach" (p.201). Although Hasted 
does not explain what he means by this, the term may refer to experimental 


--- Page 175 ---

166 
subjects entering a deep meditative or trance state to induce levitation. Stern, who 
said he had successfully levitated during the institute's experiments, explained that 
the technique used in the Soviet Union to induce human levitation is to 
enclose the prone subject within a cube of mirrors. The multiple 
images, apparently stretching in all directions to infinity, have the effect 
of disorienting the subject, who then levitates if he has the ability, (in 
Hasted, 1981, p.201) 
Neither Hasted nor Stern explains what constitutes the ability to levitate, and why 
disorientation would trigger it. In 1977 a film producer created a similar mirror 
device and Hasted put equipment inside to record whether the occupant (Stern) 
became lighter, but nothing significant happened because, according to Stern, the 
device felt too unlike the original. It is puzzling that Hasted, who is now dead, does 
not mention testing any other subjects. It seems unlikely that a scientist would go 
to the trouble of setting up this experiment and then give up after testing only one 
subject. This may indicate that to some extent government secrecy and 
disinformation have replaced or are augmenting the historical taboos against psi. 
Some levitators do not fall neatly into any of the seven groups, but that does not 
make their claims any easier to investigate. Willie G, a child who claimed to be able 
to bend pieces of metal, told Hasted (1981, p.200) that he could also levitate, but 
only when alone in his bedroom. To test the boy's claims, Hasted asked him to 
"write and put his inked fingerprints" on his bedroom ceiling, which he did 
successfully. Willie "was also able to carry a Polaroid camera up with him, to 
photograph himself in proximity to the ceiling," but Hasted admits that these results 
"do not represent good validation" (p.200). We can only speculate why Willie 
cannot levitate in front of witnesses, but it reveals some of the difficulties faced by 
parapsychologists. It also raises the question as to how many other children there 
are who can levitate but who are not being scientifically investigated. 
6.1 Shamanism 
There do not appear to be indigenous taboos against levitation; rather it is that the 
anthropological literature on shamanism generally fails to take psi events seriously. 
Some ethnographers have reported cases of levitation, but they do not seem to 
have led other researchers to pursue the matter. Kalweit (1992) explains that, 
From time immemorial fantastic abilities have been attributed to 
shamans, and they themselves have not hesitated to boast of the most 
venturesome spiritual experiences. All tribal traditions recount bizarre 
tales of mysterious powers. Academia has taken pleasure in this 


--- Page 176 ---

167 
colourful collection of the unreal, so long as it could view its 
components as fairy tales, myths, or productions of the primitive mind. 
But the moment researchers claimed to seriously investigate these 
powers, they brought down the wrath of the academic community on 
themselves. (Kalweit, 1992, p.113) 
For example, Kalweit (1992) points out that the "ethnologist Robert Lowie ... 
characterized North American Pawnee medicine men as 'masters of sleight-of-hand' 
and their abilities as tricks. But in the ethnological literature there are scarcely any 
serious suggestions — let alone investigations - of how these 'tricks' are executed" 
(p. 114). The anthropologist Dr Jeremy Narby (1998) provides a brief history of his 
profession's attitude towards shamans. The first descriptions of Siberian samans -
supposedly the origin of the word shaman - classified them as "mentally ill" (p.15). 
Even though anthropologists then realised that shamans existed in numerous 
countries, "They were unanimously considered neurotic, psychotic, hysterical, or 
schizophrenic" (Narby, 1998, p.15). In the middle of the twentieth century, most 
anthropologists changed their attitudes towards shamans and began to regard 
them as the equivalent of psychologists, philosophers, physicians, pharmacologists 
or priests. But these classifications did not recognize shamans' psi abilities 
because mainstream Western science was reluctant to acknowledge the reality of 
psi phenomena. Even today anthropologists debate the validity of many 
shamanistic beliefs. In Narby's (1998) opinion, "the reality hiding behind the 
concept of 'shamanism' reflects the anthropologist's gaze, independently of its 
angle" (p.16), which suggests that most of his colleagues will only acknowledge 
shamans' psi abilities when parapsychology is better received by modern science. 
There are a few anthropologists, such as Edith Turner (1997), who are prepared to 
risk the ridicule of their colleagues by claiming that, like shamans, they believe in 
the reality of spirits, and shamanic healing. Turner recalls that it was during field 
work in the 1950s that she first encountered indigenous beliefs in spirits, but her 
training required her to refrain from 'going native'. The fact that it has taken her 
almost fifty years to publish her assertion that "studying such a mentality from 
inside is a legitimate and valuable kind of anthropology" (para.26) reveals the 
scepticism of many of her colleagues. 
Documenting shamans' psi abilities in the field is difficult, and getting a shaman 
into a laboratory might be even harder. Anthropologists do not receive 
parapsychology training, and there may be indigenous taboos against revealing 


--- Page 177 ---

168 
certain rituals or spiritual phenomena to outsiders. Despite shamans reportedly 
possessing a large range of psi abilities, they are poorly documented in many 
anthropological texts. By not researching these abilities in more detail over the last 
century, anthropologists and para psychologists have missed a valuable opportunity 
because, as Western influences spread into indigenous communities, shamanic psi 
events may gradually become scarcer. 
6.2 Spirit Possession 
Several taboos and obstacles which hamper the impartial investigation of psi 
events that often occur during spirit possession in Western societies are to be 
found both within and outside the Christian Church. For example, after being 
exorcised, demoniacs suffer from amnesia (Cramer, 1979, p.23) so they are unable 
to testify as to whether they levitated or not. Many religions seem reluctant to 
document the psi aspects of possession cases, perhaps for reasons of privacy and 
the belief that the demoniacs had been indulging in demonic or sinful activities. 
Another reason is that in a modern, secular society many people might believe that 
claims of psi events occurring during possession were hoaxes, delusions, or 
misguided attempts to prove the existence of demonic entities. For ethical reasons 
and because the causes of spirit possession are still unclear, the phenomenon 
would be almost impossible to simulate in a laboratory. As Nicola (1974) writes, 
"because of the condemnation of superstitious practices by the Church, we are 
forbidden ... to attempt to induce diabolical manifestations for study" (p.24). 
Outside the Christian Church, many modern psychologists and psychiatrists regard 
spirit possession as a form of mental illness and therefore deny the reality of 
concurrent psi events. Whether or not a psi researcher agrees that possession 
involves mental illness, ethical restrictions normally prevent interviews with current 
or recovered demoniacs because of the possibility of emotional trauma and doubts 
about their ability to provide informed consent. On the other hand, Cramer (1979) 
acknowledges that possession involves psi events, but insists that levitation is not 
one of them. As well as contradicting the available evidence, this assertion 
unnecessarily confuses the psi dimension of these cases. 
The Church, too, sometimes appears to be confused about these matters. Michael 
Cuneo (2002) reports that in 1970 Father John Nicola and three witnesses 
observed Candido Amantini, the then official exorcist of Rome, interviewing a 


--- Page 178 ---

169 
bedridden Spanish nun who was thought to be possessed. The nun "appeared to 
rise six feet [1.83 m] in the air and remain suspended for thirty seconds or longer" 
(p.316). Cuneo quotes Nicola as saying that 
Everyone in the room saw her body levitate.... At least this was our 
experience. We saw it, but I'm not saying the body levitated. Quite 
frankly, I don't believe it actually did levitate. We may have been 
involved in a situation of mutual hypnosis. Or, from my researches in 
parapsychology/I'd propose it might have been psychokinesis. The 
point is, you can't jump to conclusions. You can't assume that the 
demonic is present. You have to rule out these other possibilities, (in 
Cuneo, 2002, p.316) 
It is unlikely that all five witnesses were hypnotised into seeing the nun levitate, and 
the claim that a person who is lifted into the air by PK is not levitating is puzzling. 
Although Nicola, who worked on several occasions with the parapsychologist Dr 
Joseph Rhine, may be correct in saying that one cannot assume that a person who 
mysteriously rises into the air is possessed, it would help if he clearly stated his 
definition of levitation. During the 1970s and 1980s Nicola was "the person most 
often turned to by American Catholic bishops seeking advice on suspected cases of 
demonization" (Cuneo, 2002, p.316), and was technical adviser for the film The 
Exorcist (1973), which includes a memorable scene of a young girl levitating, that 
was apparently inspired by the case of the Spanish nun. Nicola (1974) writes that 
there may be several reasons for what happens during cases of possible diabolical 
possession. These are: "1) fraud and deception, 2) natural scientific causes, 3) 
parapsychological causes, 4) diabolical influences, 5) miracles" (p.29). Nicola's 
suggestion that, excluding fraud and deception, human levitation has four possible 
causes is a mixture of religious speculation and science. The mechanism for 
natural, parapsychological, diabolical and miraculous psi events may actually be the 
same. The only difference between natural scientific and parapsychological causes 
is that one is currently understood by science and the other is not. If and when the 
causes of human levitation are understood, the 'para' prefix may be removed from 
the terms that are currently used to describe the phenomenon. By mixing religious 
beliefs with some scientific observations, Nicola's analysis of psi events is more of a 
hindrance than a help in understanding how levitation works. 
In another example of religious speculation, Cuneo (2002) complains that, although 
he attended about a dozen Catholic exorcisms over a two year period, he never saw 
anyone levitate, but other reliable witnesses reported that they had seen "a middle-
aged man rising four feet [1.22 m] in the air during the preliminary stages of an 


--- Page 179 ---

170 
exorcism ... [and] a hugely obese woman ... levitating in her chair, despite the efforts 
of three people to hold her down" (p.317). When Cuneo asked these witnesses why 
he always seemed to miss these dramatic events, it was suggested to him that, 
apart from luck of the draw, "it was because Satan, knowing I was a writer and not 
wanting to blow his cover, was deliberately keeping me in the dark about his very 
real powers to possess people" (p.318). This supposition may represent another 
reason why levitation during spirit possession seems so hard to document. 
6.3 Poltergeist Activity 
As mentioned previously, poltergeist activity is a psi phenomenon rather than the 
name of a group, so there are no group cultural taboos that prevent its 
investigation, but the phenomenon is sometimes demonised because its symptoms 
occasionally overlap with spirit possession. There are several inherent obstacles for 
poltergeist researchers in addition to public and scientific scepticism about psi 
matters. The first is that poltergeist cases are so rare, and, as Hasted notes, a 
typical case "will last only for a period of weeks or months" (1981, p.165), which 
means that a researcher's window of opportunity is often brief. In addition, when 
poltergeist events first start, the person or family concerned generally has little 
understanding of what is happening and will typically blame unusual noises on 
pranksters, rats, water pipes, or weather conditions. When these possibilities have 
been eliminated, most people have no idea who to turn to and so may contact the 
police, a priest, or even a journalist. If a helpful parapsychologist is found, the 
poltergeist case may have almost run its course and/or the location, to use forensic 
terminology, may have been thoroughly contaminated. The witnesses may have 
received so many contradictory or unhelpful suggestions that they are too stressed 
or confused to accept constructive advice. To make matters worse, because there 
still exists a debate as to what causes poltergeist activity — spirits or unconscious 
psi or both — there is no guaranteed method of solving the problem. 
Playfair (1980) provides an excellent account of the difficulties faced while 
investigating the Enfield poltergeist. For about fourteen months, to witness as 
many incidents as possible and provide support for the family, Playfair and Maurice 
Grosse took turns spending as much time as possible with the family in their small, 
cramped house. Such a commitment is not easy, especially when the family is 
constantly disturbed by unpredictable and sometimes frightening psi events such as 


--- Page 180 ---

171 
objects or people flying across the room. Documenting these events is difficult. As 
Roll explains, a poltergeist investigator 
cannot impose all the precautions and controls that are possible in 
experimental work, and he often has to labour under a great deal of 
uncertainty. Poltergeist studies are not for the person who craves a 
neat and well-controlled research design. (Roll, 1976, p.9) 
Another problem is that the intelligence behind poltergeist events is seldom 
cooperative. The Enfield researchers could ask questions out loud and 'the Voice' 
would answer, seemingly from the mouth of Janet, the epicentre of the case. When 
asked to produce psi phenomena, the Voice would insist that they first turn around 
or leave the room. Fodor suggests that this may be because "the gaze of the 
human eye has a checking effect" (1933/1966, p.291). Although there would be 
no witnesses, they once asked Janet to bounce up and down on the bed in the hope 
that she would then be levitated. While everyone else was outside the room, Janet 
claimed that she had "been floating in the air" (Playfair, 1980, p.151). She was 
given a red biro and asked to draw a line around the ceiling light — which could not 
be reached without moving the bed — while the experiment was repeated. When 
they finally got back into the room, "there was a thin red line round the light fitting 
on the ceiling" (p.152). Sceptics would claim that Janet had cheated, and the 
researchers could not prove otherwise. 
To confuse matters further, there are psychological reasons why the person at the 
centre of poltergeist activity may start to cheat. If a poltergeist case is the result of 
someone unconsciously relieving internal stress by projecting PK energy, then the 
sympathy and attention of investigators may gradually assist that person to become 
conscious of their stress. At times during this self-awareness process he or she 
may lapse into a slight trance and feel compelled to throw objects without knowing 
why. As Fodor points out, 
When the supernormal conditions no longer exist, the agent may 
continue to relieve his stress in a normal manner and be caught doing 
so. He then confesses; the case is branded as fraudulent; and the 
investigators return home easily overlooking the fact that the earlier 
phenomena could not have been performed normally, (in Gaddis, 
1968, p.173) 
These changing psychological dynamics are generally ignored by sceptics and the 
media, so, at the slightest hint of hoaxing, the psi aspect of poltergeist activity is 
dismissed or ridiculed, thus making the job of poltergeist researchers even harder.

6.4 Spiritualism 
There are several reasons why psi phenomena that occur during seances are 
difficult to research. The first is that most mediums only have mental (ESP) psi 
abilities, and even those with physical (PK) abilities cannot be certain whether 
anything will occur during a particular seance. Secondly, most seances are held in 
complete darkness which limits the observability of whatever psi events might occur 
and, as Lamar Keene (1977) explains, increases the opportunity for fraud. 
Dishonest mediums can trick sitters into thinking that they are levitating above 
them in the dark by gently passing a pair of shoes over their heads (Pearsall, 1972, 
p.65). Today researchers can use night-vision goggles to observe what is 
happening, but this equipment was not available during the early days of 
Spiritualism when the public's ambivalence about the phenomenon started. 
Scepticism about Spiritualism and spirit mediums is well documented, and 
scientists such as Sir William Crookes (1874/1972, p.45), who chose to research 
these subjects, were publicly criticised. 
Time and again Crookes invited eminent scientists to test Home, 
without restrictions, yet they failed or refused to take the opportunity to 
do so. We must bear this in mind when considering the merit of 
skeptical assertions about Home. Many contemporary skeptical men of 
science clearly possessed all the cowardice of their convictions. 
(Eysenck & Sargent, 1993, p.28) 
Although Home was never caught cheating, he was frequently criticised by sceptics. 
For example, Robert Browning and his wife Elizabeth were impressed when they 
witnessed a levitating table at one of Home's seances, but later the poet changed 
his mind and "eventually wrote a long poem entitled 'Mr Sludge the Medium', which 
was a thinly disguised attack on Home" (Chambers, 1998, p.82). 
Another taboo that has obstructed research into Spiritualism is disapproval by the 
Christian Church. The Spiritualist National Union (SNU) claims that early Christianity 
accepted "psychic abilities, inspirational speech, speaking in other languages, 
physical mediumship, healing and so on" (SNU, 2004b, para.3), but then 
the 4th-century Council of Nicaea brought to an end the use of 
mediums and held that divine guidance, through the Holy Spirit, should 
be sought only from the priesthood: 'false prophets' were held to be 
servants of the devil, and sorcerers, heretics and mediums were all 
targets for persecution as a result of 'witch mania'. This accelerated in 
the Middle Ages, when religious sanction for.this persecution was given 
in 1484 by a papal bull and by the publication of the Malleus 
Maleficarum or 'Hammer of the Witches'. During this long period of 
persecution anyone suspected of using psychic gifts for whatever 


--- Page 182 ---

173 
purpose was in danger of torture, trial and burning, and hundreds of 
thousands of psychics were put to death by organised 'witch-hunters'. 
(SNU, 2004b, para.4) 
Most of the Australian states inherited anti-witchcraft legislation from English law 
and, although the various acts may not have mentioned Spiritualism in particular, 
as Dr Lynne Hume (1997) explains, they did prohibit activities such as fortune 
telling, "sorcery, enchantment, or conjuration" (p.221). This can describe a spirit 
medium's behaviour at a seance or private consultation, especially if a fee is 
charged, because the authorities regarded that as a form of fraud: "As far as the 
law is concerned anyone who... in any way professes to foresee the future, is open 
to the charge of deceiving because the law regards this as an impossible task" 
(Hume, 1997, p.221). Most of these Australian acts have been repealed, but some 
still exist, although this does not mean that the state authorities are currently 
prosecuting spirit mediums or clairvoyants. According to the Pagan Awareness 
Network Australia (2004), in New South Wales the Witchcraft Act of 1735 was 
repealed in 1969 and the offence of fortune telling under the 1902 Vagrancy Act 
was repealed in 1979. In Queensland the section of the Criminal Code that applied 
to witchcraft, fortune telling and occult sciences was only repealed in 2000, but the 
Vagrants, Gaming anci Other Offences Act 1931, which makes it illegal to tell 
fortunes, is still in place. Similar acts still exist in Victoria and South Australia. Fear 
of prosecution may still therefore inhibit some spirit mediums. 
The Spiritualists that I interviewed are well aware of the various taboos and 
criticisms to which they have been subjected overyears. When asked if they 
approved of someone researching human levitation, most of them said yes. Maude 
believes that the public's traditional fear of psi phenomena is already lessening and 
that in future they will be regarded "as a natural thing and we won't think it's weird 
or peculiar or odd. [It's] just a natural force and natural process". Edward believes 
that deliberately trying to learn to levitate "would be very silly" but regards the 
religious perspective that it is the devil that levitates everyone other than saints as 
"rather one-sided". 
During their interviews, the Christian priests and pastors were asked what they 
thought about Spiritualists attempting to contact spirits of the dead and the popular 
television program Crossing Over that features the medium John Edward. Most 
were disapproving of John Edward or sceptical of his abilities, although some 


--- Page 183 ---

174 
admitted that they watched the program for amusement. Philip claims that 
contacting spirits is "Definitely contrary to our beliefs," and Kevin states that "we've 
been warned in the scriptures not to". Although Gordon thinks that attempting to 
prove that life-after-death exists is "a good cause," he believes that Spiritualists are 
"misdirected" because, for example, the entity that one contacts may be deceptive 
or demonic. Brian suggests that contacting spirits may be "very, very risky," and 
both he and Francis believe that whatever causes a medium to levitate may be 
demonic. Most of these priests appear to have a negative attitude towards psi 
abilities and have little justification for demonising those with a different spiritual 
perspective to their own. 
6.5 Alien Abductions. 
The psi aspects of close encounters are hard to research because, according to the 
governments of most countries, UFOs do not exist which implies that anyone who 
believes that they have been abducted by aliens is mistaken or deluded. Ufology is 
not an official field of academic or government research, which means that there 
are few scientists investigating the reality of UFOs and abductions, and those that 
do risk the wrath or ridicule of their peers. After Harvard Medical School 
psychiatrist Dr John Mack wrote his first book on abductions, amidst rumours of his 
imminent dismissal, a formal university investigation was convened which 
concluded that he "should widen his professional circle of research associates and 
adopt a more detached attitude towards his subjects" (in Lucas, 2001, p.5). The 
head of the investigation, Emeritus Professor Arnold Relman, stated that Dr Mack is 
"not taken seriously by his colleagues any more.... But in the interests of academic 
freedom, Harvard can afford to have a couple of oddballs" (p.5). 
Some researchers study people's opinions about UFOs and abductions rather than 
the actual reports. The sociologist Dr Erich Goode (2000) claims that believing in 
UFOs is a type of misguided paranormal belief. He says that "many, possibly most, 
scientists believe it is almost certain that intelligent life exists on planets outside 
our solar system," but, because of the great distances involved, "there simply isn't 
enough time for extraterrestrials to get here within the time span of any conceivable 
lifetime" (p.139). Goode asserts that most ufologists "are unconcerned with this 
problem, but it vexes scientists so much they feel it is insurmountable. Hence, the 
belief that UFOs are real is regarded by scientists as paranormal" (p.139). This 
illustrates the chasm between mainstream science and ufology. If UFOs are alien 


--- Page 184 ---

175 
craft they might have to travel huge distances to get to Earth, but to claim that they 
therefore cannot get here is technologically-dependent speculation. For example, 
surely the first European settlers in America would have laughed if the indigenous 
inhabitants had asserted that they could not possibly have come from Europe 
because it is too far to paddle a canoe. Aliens may travel here using technology -
teleportation for example — that modern science has yet to discover, and one way 
to investigate this is to research UFO sightings rather than ridicule them. Yet for 
some reason no Western space agency has acknowledged an interest in UFO 
research, despite the possible scientific benefits. Ironically, Paul Hill's (1995) 
posthumous book is the most detailed scientific analysis of UFOs yet published. 
Hill, who worked as a rocket scientist for NASA and its predecessor, points out that 
because his employer's policy was "that flying saucers are nonexistent" (p.24), he 
was not permitted to comment publicly about his private research into them. 
Without the support of mainstream science, ufologists are at a significant 
disadvantage. As Professor Stuart Appelle (2000) points out, there is only one peer-
reviewed ufology journal; there are no professional ufology societies; no 
professional annual ufology meetings; no ufology textbooks; and "Traditional 
sources of funding are almost nonexistent for UFO research" (p.12). Hansen (2001, 
p.248) compares UFO film profits with ufology research funding: "The movie E.T. 
(1982) grossed $400,000,000 and Independence Day (1996) grossed 
$316,000,000" while MUFON, the largest UFO organization in the USA, apparently 
listed a total expenditure of $172,048 in its 1992 tax return. 
Other ufology research problems are that, despite there being hundreds of amateur 
ufologists worldwide, it is unlikely that any of them own radar equipment that could 
track an anomalous flying object. It has often been claimed that leading Western 
nations are concealing their research into UFOs (Dolan, 2000; Fawcett & 
Greenwood, 1984), but this is almost impossible to prove despite the significant 
amount of circumstantial evidence (Good, 1989,1996). There are several possible 
reasons for governments to classify information about the reality of UFOs. The USA 
might want to master UFO propulsion technology before anyone else, and then keep 
it secret for as long as possible to maintain a military advantage. Public knowledge 
of UFO technology might threaten oil, nuclear and stock market profits. Admitting 
that aliens were visiting Earth might trigger invasion concerns. Taxpayers might 
query enormous defence budgets if it was acknowledged that alien craft can fly into 


--- Page 185 ---

anyone's airspace with impunity. The reported psi behaviour of aliens suggests that 
Western science's view of the fundamental nature of reality is seriously flawed, 
which might further undermine public faith in government. It is not the purpose of 
this research to prove the existence of UFOs or alien abductions, but a review of the 
relevant literature suggests that either someone is surreptitiously attempting to 
convince the public that they do exist, as cover perhaps for advanced weapons 
testing, or leading Western nations are secretly researching the UFO phenomenon. 
Because it is not possible to prove these claims, anyone who supports them is 
generally labelled a conspiracy theorist which implies that they are misguided and 
should be ignored. When a major UFO sighting occurs, the media generally turns to 
astronomers for comment, despite their lack of training in the subject. Almost all 
books and magazine articles on UFOs and abductions are written by amateur 
ufologists and are therefore not regarded as reliable by the scientific community. 
For example, Peter Sturrock, the then professor of space science at Stanford 
University, in an article entitled 'Brave New Heresies', wrote: 
In 1978,1 carried out a survey of the membership of the American 
Astronomical Society on UFOs, and I found that most of the members 
had open minds on the subject and that a majority thought that some 
research should be carried out.... What they wanted were refereed 
articles published in scientific journals. The difficulty was that existing 
scientific journals did not carry articles on the UFO problem, and the 
journals that did were not accepted by the scientific community. 
(Sturrock, 1988, p.51) 
Another taboo that undermines serious research into UFO close encounters is that 
aliens are seen by some as demonic entities (Downing, 1980/2001, p.155; Ritchie, 
1994, p.56) which implies that abduction researchers are not to be trusted. For 
example, the "extreme American right-winger and head of a group called the 
Christian Coalition, Pat Robertson," believes that "all UFO enthusiasts should be 
stoned ... because if UFOs exist they are demons spiriting people away from Christ" 
(Casellas & Hewitt, 1999, p.2). In a study that analyses the names (onomastics) by 
which they identify themselves during close encounters, Jean Sider concludes that 
many extraterrestrials are deceptive, unwholesome or demonic entities (in Druffel, 
2000, p.3). This novel research method may be disputed because it depends on 
the author's decision as to which names are demonic and which are not. If aliens 
are visiting Earth, they may be oblivious to the historical or religious origins of the 
names they use during close encounters. 


--- Page 186 ---

177 
The similarities between traditional folk and fairytales and abduction narratives, 
noted by Vallee (1969/1993), lead some researchers to suggest that they are not 
real experiences (Goode, 2000, p.157; Randies, Estes, & Cone, 2000, p.105) but 
may instead be produced by sleep paralysis (Pope, 1997, p.253) or electromagnetic 
effects (Budden, 1995,1998). As mentioned previously, even those researchers 
who believe in abductions are reluctant to link ufology with parapsychology. Most 
ufologists have no parapsychology training and may therefore be as ill-informed or 
prejudiced against psi research as the average scientist. This section reveals that 
the sceptical and religious attitudes that mainstream science and the public have 
towards UFOs and alien abductions are a significant obstacle to anyone trying to 
research reports of levitation associated with these phenomena. 
6.6 Martial Arts: Qigong 
Dong and Raffill (1996) state that "The more adept a master's skill at martial arts, 
the more will he shun publicity and keep that skill hidden" (p.54). The reason for 
this is that the "martial arts are considered as a health exercise and defensive 
technique, a means for self development, not self-aggrandizement" (p.55). They 
explain that an ancient martial arts tradition requires practitioners to swear not to 
show off their superior abilities, and only to use that power for defensive or moral 
purposes, such as assisting the weak against the strong. Traditionally teachers only 
passed on their most powerful techniques to students who they believed would not 
make them public. While one cannot object to these principles, they certainly 
restrict public knowledge and investigation of the psi aspects of the martial arts 
because these techniques are considered the most powerful. 
When starting his advanced training, Master Chang was obliged to undergo a formal 
Taoist ceremony which obliged him not to use his powers for evil purposes or to 
make money, and not to demonstrate his abilities to anyone except his students (in 
Danaos, 2000, p.42). Chang was encouraged to use his powers for healing, but 
could not charge his patients even though he was poor and had a wife and children 
to support. Danaos (2000) describes what happened when he broke his promise 
not to discuss Master Chang's psi feats with anyone other than fellow students. 
While driving with a friend on a clear, sunny day, he started to describe some of 
Chang's abilities. Suddenly "water kept pouring down on the windshield with 
unbridled ferocity" (p.151) obliging him to put the wipers on at full speed. The 
ground outside seemed dry and they noticed that cars travelling in the opposite 


--- Page 187 ---

178 
direction did not have their wipers on. As the torrent continued, his terrified 
passenger asked whether Danaos had perhaps said something that he should not 
have. Realising what was happening, Danaos apologised out loud, whereupon the 
rain suddenly stopped. A sceptic might claim that this was merely a passing 
shower, but Danaos insists there was not a cloud in the sky and no other cars got 
wet. It is possible that the rain was, as in poltergeist theory, the result of Danaos 
unconsciously projecting his guilt, but, whatever the cause, the incident certainly 
stopped him discussing psi matters except in his books, for which he claims to have 
his master's permission, provided he uses pseudonyms, no addresses, and only 
describes qigong techniques in general terms. 
Public scepticism is another reason why the empty force or psi aspect of qigong 
receives limited publicity. Dong and Raffill (1996) explain that one of China's empty 
force masters, Wang Xiangzhai, "lived in the conservative era of the 1930s, when 
people were loath to believe in any ability to knock people down without physical 
contact" (p.72), so his students would deny that they were using empty force 
techniques. More recently a qigong master in California warned his students not to 
promote the psi nature of their training too widely because of the damaging effect 
that public scepticism might have on his reputation (Dong & Raffill, 1996, p.72). 
Similar taboos exist today. As part of my research, I contacted a leading Australian 
meditation teacher (Personal communication, 23 January 2003) to ask if anyone 
had ever levitated in his classes. He seemed reluctant to discuss the matter and 
refused to take my contact details, saying that he was a down-to-earth person who, 
although he could not prove that it was impossible, believed that people who 
claimed to have levitated were probably deluded. It is possible that this teacher, 
whose income depends on the reputation of his meditation school, does not want 
anyone to think of him as having an interest in psi phenomena because he is aware 
of public scepticism about it. Similarly, Chenery (2004, p.16) quotes Father 
Gabriele Amorth, "the renowned chief exorcist of the Vatican," as asserting that, 
among other things, seances, witchcraft, the occult, yoga, Zen and Transcendental 
Meditation are inappropriate activities because they are "doctrines that are 
unacceptable to Christians". For some devout Catholics these comments would 
constitute a taboo against participating in activities such as these, including qigong. 


--- Page 188 ---

179 
Gruber (1999) explains that in China for the last few decades there has been a 
dispute at the highest levels about research into psi abilities. After his retirement 
back to China, Qian Xuesen, who had been a professor at the California Institute of 
Technology, became interested in psi research (p.117). He was quoted as saying 
"we should use science and technology to study human potential. Thus we should 
study Chinese traditional medical theory, qigong, exceptional functions of the 
human body, and so on" (Leping & McConnell, 1991, p.125). However, a senior 
social scientist, Yu Guangyuan, claimed that "paranormal phenomena contradicted 
Marxism, Leninism, dialectic materialism and the known laws of contemporary 
science and that they could not, therefore, be true" (in Gruber, 1999, p.118). In 
May 1982 the Secretary General of the Communist Party sided with Yu and psi 
research was declared officially unacceptable, but, because of Qian's scientific 
status, a small group of scientists was permitted to continue their research. The 
media was banned from mentioning the subject, but the scientists could circulate 
their results among themselves. "Among the population as a whole the matter was 
soon forgotten or people wrongly believed that psi phenomena had been exposed 
as fraudulent and that the Party had banned their investigation" (Gruber, 1999, 
p.119). But the research continued behind closed doors. 
The most important projects took place in a military controlled institute 
in Beijing. The sudden disappearance of psi from the public stage 
combined with the fact that the military was continuing research in 
secret made the Americans assume that China had now also jumped 
on the bandwagon of the psi arms race. (Gruber, 1999, p.119) 
So, in addition to public scepticism and martial arts taboos, research into the psi 
aspects of qigong now labours under the additional restriction of being classified by 
the Chinese government. As a possible illustration of this secrecy, I attempted to 
contact Paul Dong, who has retired to China, through a colleague of his in the USA 
who later informed me that Dong had said that he knows nothing about human 
levitation (Personal communication, 15 January 2003), which seems puzzling given 
that he mentions it several times in his books. Dong may have suspected that the 
Chinese authorities were monitoring his overseas electronic communications. 
Despite these restrictions, Chinese public interest in the health and martial arts 
components of qigong has not been curtailed because it is a part of the country's 
spiritual heritage; it is only its psi aspects that seem to be taboo. In addition, 
Gruber (1999, p.125) claims that Chinese research into this subject is not as 
methodologically sound as that in the West, although, given the size of their 
population, they probably have a rich store of gifted subjects to study. 


--- Page 189 ---

180 
During my interviews with qigong teachers — none of whom claims to have levitated 
— they were asked whether there were any taboos about the psi aspects of qigong. 
Peter agrees that abilities should not be revealed for egotistical purposes but that it 
is acceptable to use them for medical, charitable or spiritual purposes. Bernard 
explains that becoming attached to the idea of demonstrating your abilities "leads 
your concentration astray" so that "you start projecting outwards" which can 
undermine one's meditation and spiritual development. Similarly, William says that 
practitioners must ask themselves whether they are doing qigong because they 
want fame or to "develop a connection with the supreme". Victor points out that 
many advanced practitioners are humble and would not want to frighten people, 
and Harry says that some people make the mistake of thinking that certain energies 
are evil instead of realising that it is the motivation of the practitioner that matters, 
so keeping quiet about one's abilities is probably a wise tactic. Unlike the others, 
Jeremy denies that qigong has anything to do with psi and claims that, while it may 
be possible, no one has ever levitated. He asserts that there are no unknown 
energies associated with qigong, although he agrees that some masters will only 
reveal their abilities to others in the same field. The martial arts taboos about psi 
abilities reveal how difficult it would be to find and study a qigong practitioner who 
can levitate. 
6.7 Mysticism 
In most mystical traditions a prevalent taboo is that psi abilities are a distraction on 
the spiritual pathway. This acknowledges that advanced psi abilities can be used to 
acquire wealth, power and probably an inflated ego, which are counterproductive in 
any spiritual tradition. These taboos are often packaged as witty stories or 
parables. DrThelma Moss recounts 
a Zen story about a disciple who left his teacher to spend years in 
solitary meditation. On his return, his guru asked what he had learned, 
and the disciple with some pride answered, 'I have learned to walk 
across the river, on the water.' Without surprise, in fact with a sigh of 
disappointment, the guru replied, 'What a pity! For only one rupee, the 
ferry can carry you across'. (Moss, 1997, p.130) 
Such stories may promulgate spiritual taboos against vanity and psi distractions 
within a community of mystics, but when broadcast to the wider community, as they 
are today, people may conclude that there is something inherently inappropriate 
about psi abilities, even if one is not on a spiritual pathway. If someone today learnt 
how to walk on water, it would be absurd to suggest that the ability should not be 


--- Page 190 ---

181 
used or researched. No one tells gifted chess players, mathematicians, or 
musicians that it is inappropriate to demonstrate or make a career out of their 
abilities. If human levitation does exist, there is nothing unethical about using or 
researching the phenomenon. Apart from telling us more about the nature of 
human consciousness, it is possible that the psi energy involved could benefit fields 
as varied as healing, transportation, or space exploration. Nevertheless, although 
there are many reports of levitating mystics, none of them seem to have 
demonstrated this ability to modern researchers. 
One of my Spiritualists interviewees provided a frustrating example of this sort of 
taboo. Claudette claims that a few years ago she accompanied her sister-in-law to 
an Australian Tibetan Buddhist meditation centre. While the sister-in-law went to do 
her regular meditation class, Claudette, who had not been there before, was asked 
by a nun who was showing her around the centre if she was "interested in seeing a 
demonstration with some lamas that were visiting from Tibet". After agreeing, 
Claudette was taken to a large room where about seven or eight monks were 
"sitting in the lotus position, cross-legged, and without any sort of momentum being 
able to jump up". The monks were hopping across the room, rather like 
Transcendental Meditation practitioners, which Claudette does not regard as true 
levitation. Her guide then told her to watch a lama 
who was at the front of the room, and he was actually lying on his side 
on the floor.... After about two minutes I actually realized that his robes 
were hanging rather than tightly being around him. And that's when I 
realised he was actually being raised, somehow, off the floor; still lying 
in the lying position. 
The lama had his eyes open and "one hand propping his head up, and the other just 
lying on top of him, by his side". She watched for about half an hour during which 
time the lama "would've raised probably about six feet [1.83 m] off the floor". 
Claudette was rather sceptical, so asked her guide what was holding the lama in the 
air. "Absolutely nothing," said the nun, who called a young man over and whispered 
something in his ear. The young man "approached the monk and ran his hand 
underneath him to show that there was nothing there". He then got a small, self-
supporting step-ladder, "and he got to the top and ran his hand above the monk". 
There were several other people in the room who were as amazed as Claudette. 
She recalls one witness calling out that they were experiencing a mass 
hallucination, but she did not agree with him. Claudette, who claims to be able to 
see auras, noted that the levitating lama 


--- Page 191 ---

182 
had the most amazing golden-white aura. And I must admit I was 
amazed at the height... [and] the width of his aura. It just seemed to 
fill the whole area that he was in; the whole width of the room. 
Auras are thought to signify a degree of holiness or spiritual development (Inglis, 
1986, p.169), which suggests that the lama was able to levitate because he was an 
advanced meditator. The lama then gradually descended to the ground. "He 
stayed there for a while, then he stood up, and he walked over to one side of the 
hall and sat cross-legged and proceeded to do the jumping" like the other monks. 
Claudette, who is not a Buddhist, says that the levitating lama was referred to as a 
rinpoche (a Tibetan Buddhist title given to a spiritually advanced person who is 
regarded as a reincarnation of a previous master or senior lama). In an attempt to 
obtain confirmation about the levitating rinpoche, I contacted the only Tibetan 
Buddhist centre in that suburb. The lama who replied wrote that he knew of no 
visiting rinpoche who had levitated and that he was 
not aware of any such demonstration.... Our Tibetan Buddhist practice 
may enable advanced yogis to have such ability, but demonstrating in 
public will be against the code of ethics of the practitioner. Basically it 
is a capacity we all have, but many do not know how to apply its proper 
use. (Personal communication, 3 March 2003) 
I asked the lama how levitation could be regarded as unethical, and he replied that 
Levitation is not unethical behaviour but showing it [to] others without 
special reasons will be regarded as spiritual transgression. A 
practitioner must not show off his or her spiritual accomplishment. If 
he does, it breaks his vow of humility. (Personal communication, 5 
March 2003) 
It is hard to interpret this situation. I may have contacted the wrong meditation 
centre; the lama may be unaware that a visiting rinpoche levitated in front of some 
visitors in his centre; or he may be denying that the levitation occurred to give the 
impression that his colleagues have not broken their code of ethics and vows of 
humility. If Claudette is telling the truth, one could dispute whether the levitation 
she witnessed qualifies as showing off in public, as it took place within the 
meditation centre. If he is obstructing levitation research, the lama is helping 
ensure that scepticism about the subject will continue. 
To explain levitation, the lama I contacted wrote that "one who can control [the] 
inner five elements can do many things such as levitation". These elements (called 
wu-hsing in Taoism) or "five phases of transformation, or five energies that 
determine the course of natural phenomena" (Fischer-Schreiber, 1999b, p.417) are 


--- Page 192 ---

183 
water, fire, wood, metal and earth and "are not to be understood as real substances 
but rather as abstract forces and symbols for certain basic characteristics of 
matter" (p.417). Claiming that levitation results from controlling these five 
elements is not particularly helpful, although it does suggest that a high degree of 
self-mastery, as in yoga and the martial arts, is needed to produce such psi 
phenomena. 
I contacted the local representative of a Buddhist society to ask what he knew 
about human levitation (Personal communication, 14 February, 2003). He pointed 
out that no lamas from his tradition would demonstrate levitation while visiting 
Australia, and they would actively resist the investigation of such matters because 
they were of little importance to a person's spiritual development. He said that he 
had been studying Buddhism for nearly thirty years but that his master would still 
not give him any information about psi abilities. 
The Buddha himself is claimed to be one source of Buddhist taboos against psi 
abilities. He regarded psi abilities or siddhis 
equivocally because some non-Buddhist ascetics possessed them too; 
they were a sign of meditational attainment only, and not a spiritual 
qualification; and they could be put to bad as well as good use.... He, 
therefore, attempted to lessen their importance by making it an offence 
for monks or nuns to display them before the layfolk. (Bowker, 1997, 
p.464) 
Similarly, Woodward explains that Buddha was well aware that 
with spiritual discipline (asceticism and meditation) a monk can 
eventually fly in the air, make his body invisible to others, and otherwise 
manifest the miraculous powers... that accompany advancement 
towards liberation from the cycle of rebirth. But he forbids his monks 
from exhibiting these powers before the laity. To do so is a 
manifestation of vanity and therefore a sign of retrogression in the 
struggle to achieve liberation from attachments to a spurious self. 
(Woodward, 2000, p.24) 
In Tantric Buddhism "Deliberate pursuit of such power is generally frowned upon by 
the more advanced adepts who, if they happen to acquire them, take pains not to 
display them except in circumstances which fully warrant their immediate use" 
(Blofeld, 1974, p.222). However, Blofeld also points out that "telepathy is so 
common as to excite no comment in Tibet.... I have more than once had cause to 
redden on discovering that the Lama I was talking to had an all too accurate 
knowledge of my thoughts!" (p.40). Buddhist ambivalence towards psi abilities is 


--- Page 193 ---

184 
illustrated by a story about the Tibetan yogi Milarepa (1052-1135) who is reported 
to have once levitated over the heads of some distant relatives who were ploughing 
a field. "The man's son ... spotted the levitating monk and called to his father to 
stop work and observe the miracle. Milarepa's relative looked up, saw the levitating 
holy man, and firmly instructed his son to ignore that 'good-for-nothing' and get 
back to work" (Rogo, 1991,29). 
In his translation of Patanjali's yoga-sutras, Taimini points out that the various 
siddhis can become obstacles for a yogi who is 
diving within the deeper layers of his consciousness because they tend 
to draw consciousness outwards. That is why the mystic fights shy of 
all such powers. He does not want to have anything to do with Siddhis 
because their exercise creates all kinds of temptations and distractions 
in his path. (Taimini, 1975, p.343) 
Islam is equally suspicious of miracles. 
In the Qur'an, the Prophet Muhammad rejects every request to work 
miracles, saying that the Qur'an is itself a miracle and the only one 
Muslims need. It is only in the ahadith, or oral traditions of the 
Prophet's life, that we find the miracle stories of Muhammad. 
(Woodward, 2000, p.24) 
The Catholic Church is also ambivalent about miraculous abilities. The Croatian 
stigmatist Father Zlatko Sudac claims to have "the gifts of levitation, bilocation, 
illumination, and the knowledge of upcoming events" (Sudac, 2002), but when 
asked about them during an interview he declined to elaborate further until the 
Catholic hierarchy had made a pronouncement about the matter. Had he 
demonstrated his ability to levitate before some journalists there might now be less 
scepticism about the reality of the phenomenon. Woodward (2000) explains that 
the "Hebrew Bible is equally wary of miracles. Because miracles always manifest 
power, and because that power can come from evil as well as divine sources, 
miracles alone are never to be trusted" (p.24). The Catholic Church requires 
thorough documentation of miraculous events, but one of the problems is "that 
popular Catholic piety tends to confuse genuine mysticism with unusual 
experiences and 'supernatural' powers - a confusion which, in the opinion of saint-
makers, has given sanctity a bad reputation" (Woodward, 1991, p.163). Displaying 
a similar attitude to other major religions, Father Gumpel explains that experiencing 
"stigmata, visions, levitations, bilocations, and other such phenomena" does not 
make a person a saint. "We are looking for ordinary sanctity. We are trying to 


--- Page 194 ---

185 
counter the idea that saints are people who have had unusual experiences" (in 
Woodward, 1991, p.163). 
The Catholic Church's treatment of Joseph of Cupertino illustrates its wariness 
towards psi phenomena. The Church was so embarrassed by the public's reaction 
to his frequent levitations that he was banned from celebrating mass in public, 
obliged to eat his meals in private and frequently moved around the country. 
Pastrovicchi (1918/1980, p.15) explains that after being accused of deliberately 
seeking attention and performing "works which the credulous believed to be 
miracles" (p.15), Joseph was summoned before the Inquisition. He "was detained 
[for] several weeks and examined three times, but no shadow of fault was 
discovered and his life was found to be worthy of admiration" (p.17). Despite the 
persecution that he suffered during his life, Joseph was canonised after death, not 
because of his psi abilities but for his sanctity. 
Thurston (1952) provides another reason why the Church may be cautious about 
publicising psi events, and why people may be sceptical about miraculous reports 
found in books such as Butler's Lives of the Saints (Butler, 1756-9/1956). 
A prejudice against the literature of the supernatural seems to have 
been created by the uncritical methods of hagiographers. Living 
themselves in an atmosphere of unquestioning faith, they have 
accepted and repeated without discrimination all the marvels of which 
they found any record, and it has rarely occurred to them that the 
statements of virtuous and well-meaning people are sometimes as 
untrustworthy as those of unscrupulous romancers. (Thurston, 1952, 
p.l) 
During their interviews most of the priests and pastors said that they had no 
objections to research into human levitation. As Thomas said, "I have no problem 
with it being researched. I think if there's a reason for it, it's good to know how it 
happens". However, as Philip pointed out, "A miracle to me is an act of God and 
purely God alone, whereas a paranormal event could have a logical human 
explanation". For this reason, Philip claims that 
I don't believe you'll come up with some way you can get people to 
levitate on demand. That's not to say that... you might be able to 
invent some particular machine that can defy gravity or something like 
that... but in that miraculous sense I don't believe that you'll be able to 
recreate it. 
This illustrates the belief that miracles cannot be investigated because science can 
never discover how God operates. For example, Michael claims that "There have 


--- Page 195 ---

186 
been many miracles I've witnessed over my thirty-odd years of ministry that certainly 
are totally inexplicable". He believes that "a miracle is something that is beyond our 
own investigation and comprehension". As mentioned earlier, one obstacle for 
those researching psi events is the religious distinction between supposedly 
miraculous, demonic or psi events. For example, Leroy (1928) writes that "If the 
levitation of mediums is regarded as genuine, the analysis of its physical 
characteristics and the description of its psychological circumstances preclude any 
likening of it to that of Catholic mystics" (p.250). Leroy seems to be claiming that 
the levitation of saints and mediums cannot have the same-* scientific explanation, 
which illustrates that some Christians disapprove of the idea that all forms of 
human levitation could work the same way. For example, because they believe that 
the devil sometimes levitates people, some of the interviewees said that they would 
disapprove of someone trying to train themselves to levitate. 
6.8 Chapter Summary 
The theme that this chapter documents is that there are longstanding and more 
recent taboos against psi phenomena in many of the seven groups, as well as 
numerous practical obstacles to researching levitation. Religious taboos about psi 
events are the most prevalent and have affected almost all of the groups at some 
time. As Leroy (1928) illustrates, the Christian Church has demonised shamans, 
Spiritualists, possessed people, some cases of poltergeist activity and, today, there 
are those who see aliens as demonic entities. 
The fact that taboos against psi activities have existed in almost every religion for 
thousands of years suggests that throughout that time it has been known by 
spiritual leaders that a significant percentage of those on the mystical pathway will 
develop these abilities. In other words, although the leaders may not have been 
interested in validating them, they were well aware that psi abilities existed and that 
they were capable of corrupting or distracting spiritual aspirants who were not 
sufficiently advanced to have overcome their normal human vanity and egotism. A 
sceptic might claim that the taboos were invented to mislead people into believing 
that divine powers exist, but the volume of anecdotal evidence about other psi 
abilities mentioned in the previous chapter suggests that this is not the case. Not 
only do these taboos imply that psi abilities exist, and are linked to spiritual entities 
and ASCs, but they add weight to the traditional mystical claim that consciousness 


--- Page 196 ---

187 
underlies physical reality, or that at some level there is a link between mind, matter 
and energy. 
Being aware of these taboos and obstacles is important for future researchers 
seeking levitators to study because they provide useful information as to what 
cultural, religious and practical obstacles need to be addressed before such people 
might be prepared to demonstrate or explain their abilities. Without these taboos, 
people who spontaneously found themselves levitating, or had learnt to do it 
deliberately, would have felt free to publicise or demonstrate their abilities. 
Although this does not guarantee that science would by now have discovered how 
levitation works, it would certainly make it easier to find levitators to study. The 
phenomenon would today probably be regarded with less scepticism by scientists 
and the public, and speculative religious explanations which, from an empirical 
perspective, merely replace one mystery with another, would be less prevalent. 
Without these taboos there would almost certainly be more well-witnessed levitation 
reports than there are today.

Chapter 7 
Almost Levitating 
As has been pointed out previously, there are some reports of levitation and mass 
control that do not fall neatly into any of the seven groups. These examples are 
discussed in this chapter because they may reveal something about how levitation 
works and might even suggest that there is more than one way to levitate. In 
discussing these miscellaneous reports and groups it will be noted that most of 
them share several of the main groups' themes, which can be interpreted as 
increasing their credibility and relevance to this study. 
7.1 Lung-gom 
In Tibet there exists a phenomenon called lung-gom which roughly translates as 
"mastery of the energy currents" (Fischer-Schreiber, 1999c, p.207), and is achieved 
by meditation, breath control and concentration on the element of air and its 
corresponding psychic centre (chakra) within the body. The mastery of this 
particular energy current "was used, among other things, to cover long stretches on 
foot effortlessly and in the shortest possible time" (p.207). The air chakra is 
normally called the fourth or heart chakra (Johari, 1987, p.63). "Running, hunting, 
using strength, shrinking (contraction), and growth of the body (expansion) are 
related to the air element" (Johari, 1987, p.98), which is interesting because, as 
well as being able to levitate, on several occasions Home's body was seen to 
elongate while he was in a trance. Johari (1987) points out that "The heart chakra 
is the seat of balance within the body, moving towards a uniform energy flow in both 
upward and downward directions" (p.65). Lama Anagarika Govinda (1970) says 
that the air element is central to lung-gom because it involves learning to control 
one's breath through pranayama (p.81). Blofeld (1974) writes that lung-gom 
enables people in a state of trance to cover great distances at amazing 
speed leaping like a ball and negotiating obstacles with supernormal 
dexterity. In a country devoid of vehicles and telegraphs, this must 
have been extremely useful for sending messages between 
monasteries situated far from one another. (Blofeld, 1974, p.223) 
Alexandra David-Neel (1965) describes encountering a lung-gom-pa, who is a 
person using their lung-gom training "to take extraordinarily long tramps with 
amazing rapidity" (p.199). Because she did not wish to break his trance, she could 
only watch as the lung-gom-pa sped past. 
I could clearly see his perfectly calm impassive face and wide-open 
eyes with their gaze fixed on some invisible far-distant object situated 
somewhere high up in space. The man did not run. He seemed to lift 


--- Page 198 ---

189 
himself from the ground, proceeding by leaps. It looked as if he had 
been endowed with the elasticity of a ball and rebounded each time his 
feet touched the ground. His steps had the regularity of a pendulum. 
(David-Neel, 1965, p.202) 
David-Neel (1965) was told that lung-gom breath and meditation training can last 
several years, often in strict seclusion. When sufficiently advanced, the lamas are 
given a "mystic formula" which is repeated in rhythm with their breathing and 
footsteps (p.214). Another part of the training resembles the exercises that today's 
Transcendental Meditation practitioners use. 
The student sits cross-legged on a large and thick cushion. He inhales 
slowly and for a long time, just as if he wanted to fill his body with air. 
Then, holding his breath, he jumps up with legs crossed, without using 
his hands and falls back on his cushion, still remaining in the same 
position. He repeats that exercise a number of times during each 
period of practice. Some lamas succeed in jumping very high in that 
way. (David-Neel, 1965, p.207) 
According to Tibetan tradition these practitioners become very light and may 
eventually learn to levitate (p.208). David-Neel claims to have briefly seen another 
lung-gom-pa in a Tibetan forest sitting naked on a rock "with iron chains rolled all 
round his body" (p.209). Her assistant said that "They wear these chains to make 
themselves heavy, for through the practice of lung-gom, their bodies have become 
so light that they are always in danger of floating in the air" (p.210). 
While in Tibet, Lama Govinda experienced something resembling lung-gom after he 
miscalculated how long it would take to return to his camp and, as night fell, 
realised that he would have to cross numerous huge boulders to get back safely. 
Night had completely overtaken me; and yet to my amazement I 
jumped from boulder to boulder without ever slipping or missing a 
foothold, in spite of wearing only a pair of flimsy sandals on my bare 
feet. And then I realised that a strange force had taken over, a 
consciousness that was no more guided by my eyes or my brain. My 
limbs moved as in a trance, with an uncanny knowledge of their own, 
though their movements seemed almost mechanical. I noticed things 
only like in a dream, somewhat detached. Even my own body had 
become distant, quasi-detached from my will power. I was like an 
arrow that unfailingly pursued its course by the force of its initial 
impetus, and the only thing I knew was that on no condition must I 
break the spell that had seized me. (Govinda, 1970, p.77) 
Although he was not actually levitating, Govinda here illustrates several of the 
themes that are involved in levitation. He was an experienced meditator and his 
surefooted leaps from rock to rock in the dark show how various psi abilities - such 
as clairvoyance and mass control - can sometimes work together when a person is 


--- Page 199 ---

190 
in a suitable ASC. Govinda's psi agility may be what advanced martial arts 
practitioners are attempting to achieve. 
David-Neel writes that "men who travelled with supernormal rapidity are mentioned 
in many traditions" (1965, p.199). Charles and Jordan (1995) provide several 
examples from shamanism. Rather than running, the Yurok Indians of Northern 
California were reported to be able to glide along the ground. They 
would contact 'unseen forces' and then make the trail their ally by 
talking to it and singing to it. Instead of feeling their feet pushing 
against the earth, the runners visualized the earth pushing against their 
feet, helping them along. And aided by breathing techniques and hand 
motions, the runners propelled themselves forward with an invisible 
rope. (Charles & Jordan, 1995, p.98) 
A second example refers to an old Australian Aboriginal shaman or 'clever man' 
called Cranky Jimmy who set out on a four mile [6.6 km] walk to a ration station. 
Two younger friends followed shortly afterwards and were astonished to meet 
Jimmy coming back with his rations. The friends took three hours to cover a 
distance that Jimmy, using his spirits to take him along quickly, travelled in less 
than one hour (Charles & Jordan, 1995, p.104). 
Several Catholic examples that resemble lung-gom are to be found among the well-
witnessed visionary incidents that occurred in 1961 to four young ecstatic girls in 
the small Spanish mountain village of Garabandal. Most of the psi phenomena 
experienced by the girls were witnessed by the respected Spanish attorney and 
professor of economics Francisco Sanchez-Ventura y Pascual (1978). At various 
times the girls would become entranced and walk around the village followed by 
crowds of onlookers. What was so extraordinary about the way they walked was 
that, with "their heads craned back at an incredible angle" (p.56), and despite the 
rough ground, they sometimes moved so fast that people would have to run to keep 
up with them. In addition, the girls showed no signs of tiredness and "in summer 
they were oblivious to the heat and never perspired, despite the breakneck speed of 
their walks" (p.56). Even more bizarrely, either individually or together, they 
sometimes walked backwards (p.72), and occasionally "they advanced on their 
knees, and, once, even sitting down" (p.72). Sanchez-Ventura y Pascual (1978) 
writes that "the ecstatic child halted in her tracks and started to run downhill 
backwards, scarcely brushing the stony ground in her passage, her smiling gaze 
never leaving the night sky" (p.104). On another occasion he describes seeing one 


--- Page 200 ---

191 
of them "running backwards, her gaze piercing the gloom overhead, avoiding 
obstacles and pot holes as if she had eyes in the back of her head" (p.lll). 
Numerous photographs and witnesses confirm these incidents, but they cannot 
verify the girls' explanation for their psi abilities, which is that the subject of their 
visions, the Virgin Mary, was protecting them. The Garabandal incidents, which 
included levitation, mass control and excessive gravitation, suggest that reports of 
lung-gom from Tibet and elsewhere are probably reliable and are also related to 
levitation. This section's examples are reminiscent of the techniques and 
explanations for psi abilities proposed by members of the seven groups, which 
include ASCs, spiritual entities or unseen powers and breath control. 
7.2 Hypnosis, Mesmerism and Animal Magnetism 
In the days of animal magnetism and mesmerism, some European practitioners 
discovered that when certain subjects entered a deep or somnambulistic trance 
they would manifest what came to be called the 'higher phenomena of mesmerism 
(Inglis, 1989, p.52). Most often these were instances of clairvoyance, such as 
predicting future events or seeing what was happening at a distant location, but 
sometimes PK events such as levitation were reported. Perhaps because of poor 
documentation or the scepticism of subsequent researchers, there are today few 
detailed reports of these levitations available. Fodor (1933/1966) claims that "In 
the age of animal magnetism Billot reported that his somnambules sometimes rose 
into the air" and that "Charpignon ... says that a mesmerist of Rouen, named 
Bourguignon, could lift several of his subjects from the ground by placing his hand 
over the epigastrium" (p.195). The epigastrium is the "upper part of the abdomen, 
in the angle of the ribs over the stomach" (Wingate, 1972, p.155). It lies between 
the third and fourth chakras and is near the dantien (qigong), so, if these reports 
are true, whatever caused them may be connected with these energy centres. 
Leroy (1928) quotes a letter (dated 3 June 1840) from Bourguignon to Dr 
Charpignon in which he describes one such experiment. Because Bourguignon had 
found that his patient's limbs would follow the movement of his own, he put his 
hand "two or three inches [5 or 7.5 cm] over the epigastrium, and the whole body 
was raised and remained suspended" (p.29). He then placed his hand "over his 
head and lift[ed] him up from the floor so as to be able to pass my hand or a stick 
several times under his feet" (p.29). Bourguignon claimed that with this patient the 
experiment had succeeded "eight times out of ten, but he had failed with every 
other subject" (in Leroy, 1928, p.29). The crown of the head is the location of the 


--- Page 201 ---

192 
seventh chakra which is considered the most powerful. Although Bourguignon does 
not say how many other patients he tried to levitate, the fact that he only succeeded 
with one suggests that the levitations resulted from the patient's sensitivity to 
whatever energy is involved, which resembles Dong and Raffill's (1996, p.42) claim 
about people's varying susceptibility to chi, arid the Russian physicist Stern's 
comment about only some people having the ability to levitate using a mirror box (in 
Hasted. 1981, p.201). 
Dingwall (1967) describes a somnambulistic girl (p.213) and some magnetised 
people (p.23) levitating, and Leroy (1928) quotes an 1840 report by Ricard, which 
claims that "a Dr Schmidt of Vienna, who wanted to magnetise his daughter for 
some therapeutic purpose, was very surprised one day when he found that his 
patient arose above her bed under his passes" (p.29). Similar results were 
obtained by Dr Justinus Kerner when he magnetised Frederica Hauffe (1801-1829), 
known as the Seeress of Prevorst. As well as having powerful clairvoyant abilities, if 
put into a bath while in a tranr s she would float "on the top of the water like a cork. 
If Dr Kerner placed his fingers against her own he could act like a magnet and could 
lift her from the ground" (Fodor, 1933/1966, p.195). Meiton (2001) says that 
many of the abilities of magnetised subjects were a precursor to Spiritualism. When 
in a trance, Hauffe seemed able to communicate with the dead; "physical 
phenomena were witnessed in her presence, knockings, rattling of chains, 
movement of objects without contact, and, in short, such manifestations as were 
characteristic of a poltergeist" (p.767). She also spoke languages that were similar 
to Coptic and Arabic (Fodor, 1933/1966, p.160). Alan Gauld (1992) admits that 
magnetisers often claimed that they could draw the limbs and bodies of some of 
their patients (p.153), but he seems reluctant to use the word levitation in this 
context. For example, when describing Hauffe's psi abilities he writes that she "also 
exhibited some much less common phenomena" (p.151), but fails to name them. 
Cyril Scott describes a levitation example that resembles animal magnetism or 
hypnosis. Having agreed to provide a demonstration/Scott's master instructed one 
of his students, called Arkwright, to lie on his back. 
The master stood over him, placed his hand about two feet [61 cm] 
above his recumbent body, then slowly raised it and Arkwright rose in 
the air, as if he were being pulled up by an invisible cord. He remained 
for about one minute suspended a yard [91 cm] above the top of the 
platform, then slowly sank down again, (in Moss, 1997, p.350) 


--- Page 202 ---

193 
No mention is made of the master putting his student in a trance or making passes 
over him, but the master may have already been aware of Arkwright's sensitivity to 
the levitation force, although this does not explain how the phenomenon works. 
The term animal magnetism is confusing because it does not refer to normal 
magnetism. As Long (1954, p.72) explains, when a magnet is placed near a piece 
of metal both objects are pulled towards each other. With animal magnetism, 
however, the pull only goes one way which appears to contradict the laws of 
physics. To illustrate this, Long describes an experiment by Baron Ferson who once 
directed his magnetism into one of a row of light folding chairs. A young woman, 
who had not seen which chair was magnetised, was then asked to walk along the 
row and "as she came opposite the magnetised chair she was almost violently 
pulled down towards it" (Long, 1954, p.74). Long concludes that, "The rule seems 
to be that the object — regardless of its size or weight - which has the heavier 
charge of vito-magnetic force pulls to it the less charged object, feeling no 
corresponding pull on itself as a reaction" (p.74). While being trained by an African 
Berber kahuna (shaman), W.R. Stewart was told that "vital force could be stored in 
wood, stone, water and the human body, also in the invisible body of a 'ghost'. This 
force could be expended suddenly and thus move very heavy objects" (in Long. 
1954, p.70). Vital force seems similar to chi, because, as Danaos (2000) reports, 
yin Chi can move beyond the confines of the physical body (p.22), and, although 
living people are essentially yang, spirits are composed of yin energy (p.51). 
Similarly, Dr Serge King (1992) claims that the anomalous energy used in 
mesmerism and many other fields suggests "a single 'protoenergy' which is either a 
carrier for or an effect of all other energies" (p.xiii). 
Long (1954, p.72) describes how Arthur Spray, a powerful hypnotist, once 
demonstrated this magnetic force on a young man. While lying on the floor, the 
subject was put into a deep trance causing his body to become rigid. Spray stood at 
his feet, commanded him to open his eyes and then beckoned him with his hand. 
Slowly the head and shoulders of the subject rose of their own accord 
into the air, the heels remaining on the floor. Inch by inch the rigid body 
lifted at the head until it stood at a right angle a good four feet [1.22 mj 
from the carpet. It was held there for a few seconds, then the 
beckoning of the hand was reversed and the body slowly descended to 
the floor. (Long, 1954, p.72) 


--- Page 203 ---

194 
Where does this force come from? The man weighed over 63 kg, yet Spray felt no 
pull on his own body or hand (p.73). Although this was only partial levitation, the 
force may be strong enough to lift someone off the ground. As in other levitation 
reports, the force seems to be related to spirits and ASCs and can facilitate other 
psi phenomena such as healing. It would not be difficult or costly to conduct 
experiments in which a number of somnambulistic subjects, who were also 
sensitive to chi energy, were magnetised or put into a hypnotic trance to see if they 
spontaneously levitated or could be drawn off the ground. If even one subject 
levitated it would prove the reality of the phenomenon, and although the experiment 
would not immediately reveal how levitation works, it might enable researchers to 
investigate the differences between levitating subjects and those that do not. 
7.3 Witchcraft 
Transvection describes the medieval claim that witches could fly through the air, 
generally on broomsticks. This subject has always been controversial because the 
devil and various demons were supposedly involved in these activities, and even 
though some psi phenomena may have occurred, historical research suggests that 
most of those who were condemned for witchcraft were innocent victims of religious 
hysteria. Even at the time, claims of witches flying were disputed and today 
witchcraft researchers provide little evidence about transvection, although this may 
be the result of modern scepticism about psi phenomena. This research is 
interested in whether there exists evidence that any witches couid levitate and, if 
so, what they believed caused it. Hughes (1965) acknowledges that there was "an 
accepted belief in flight as a supernatural practice. We have the possibility also of 
actual levitation in ecstatic states ... which might be an ingredient in the magical 
arcana of witchcraft" (p.132). One amusing l?"1 century report involves some 
French soldiers in Calais who fired their muskets upwards into a black cloud 
because they heard voices coming from it. To their surprise a fat, drunk, naked old 
woman landed at their feet with a wound in her thigh (Pickering, 1998, pp.230 & 
481). At the trial of the Somerset witches in the 1660s, "Mrs Julian Cox calmly 
related how one evening she had met three people flying on broomsticks some four 
or five feet [1.2-1.5 m] above the ground" (Pickering, 1998, p.481). Some witches 
confessed to flying either physically or by imagination (Guiley, 1989, p.127) which 
could refer to teleportation, levitation, or out-of-body travel, but, because people 
accused of witchcraft were often tortured, these confessions are suspect. Doreen 
Valiente writes that witches used to perform 


--- Page 204 ---

195 
a kind of jumping dance, riding on staffs; and if broomsticks were used 
for this purpose, too, it is easy to see how this dance, combined with 
the witches' experience of wild visions and dreams of flying while in a 
stage of magical trance, gave rise to the popular picture of broomstick-
riding witches in flight through the air. (Valiente, 1984, p.49) 
Pickering (1998) acknowledges that "In reality few witches ever confessed to flying 
on broomsticks, although many admitted performing ritual dances at covens while 
straddling a length of stick" (p.74). Margaret Murray (1931/1970, p.89) claims 
that there is little evidence of witches flying through the air. but there are numerous 
references to the use of oils or ointments to facilitate travel (p.91). Also called 
unguents, these ointments were made using recipes that often included 
hallucinogenic ingredients (Guiley, 1989, p.255). In 1560, Giambattista Porta 
reported that, having promised to get him some information from a distant town, a 
witch lapsed into a trance after smearing herself with ointment. When she awoke 
she insisted that she had actually flown to distant locations (Robbins, 1981, p.514). 
This suggests that for some witches transvection involved out-of-body experiences 
(OBEs). Guiley asserts that modern research supports these claims: 
In modern times, Dr Erich-Will Peuckert of the University of Gottingen, 
West Germany, tested a medieval flying ointment recipe on himself and 
a colleague.... The ointment caused the two men to fall into a 
trancelike sleep for 20 hours, during which each had nearly identical 
dreams of flying through the air to a mountain top and participating in 
erotic orgies with a monster and demons. (Guiley, 1989, p.255) 
These results are strengthened by the fact that Peuckert's colleague "knew nothing 
about witchcraft or the supposed effects of the witches' salve" (Valiente, 1984, 
p.146). In support of the OBE interpretation, Harpur (1994, p.229) notes that using 
broomsticks to fly is reminiscent of shamans using objects such as sticks to 
symbolise horses when they travel to the otherworld in a trance. If some of their 
activities did originate from shamanism, it is possible that some witches may have 
had similar psi abilities to those reported in that field, which include changing into 
animal forms, OBEs, levitation and teleportation. Julio Caro Baroja (1982) 
concludes that for centuries it was believed that certain women "could change 
themselves and others at will into animals"; that "they could fly through the air by 
night and enter the most secret and hidden places by leaving their bodies behind"; 
and that "they could bring about storms" (p.79). Montague Summers (1973, 
p.140) recounts an example where a woman saw her husband anoint his body with 
an ointment and then disappear from sight, which, if true, might be a case of 
teleportation. Similarly, Parrinder (1963) states that it was thought that the devil 


--- Page 205 ---

196 
could whisk witches through the air "or make them arrive instantaneously at their 
destination" (p.43). In answer to the question of how, if they flew in full physical 
form, witches could fit up chimneys and through certain windows, Summers (.1973) 
reports that, to facilitate their flight, the devil would magically remove any obstacles 
(p.141). This explanation is surprisingly similar to reports where abductees claim 
that aliens somehow carry them through walls, ceilings, closed windows and the 
hulls of UFOs without injury. 
Valiente (1989) claims to have acquired reliable information about witchcraft from 
the discarnate spirit of a male witch (or wizard) called Brakespeare. She writes that 
One very strange thing that Brakespeare told me was that witches in 
the old days really did develop the power of levitation. He assured me 
that the stories of 'flying witches' were based on fact, although greatly 
exaggerated in popular belief. I have never personally seen a witch 
levitate, but I, have been told by a young woman who was a traditional 
witch that sometimes, while dancing in a circle and totally absorbed in 
the rite, she has found herself becoming weightless and floating a few 
inches above the ground. As soon as she became conscious of what 
was happening, she sank to the ground again. (Valiente, 1989, p.107) 
Although this claim links ASCs and levitation, I have not found any other 
unambiguous reports of levitation in the literature on modern witchcraft, which 
today is generally called Wicca or (Neo-)Paganism by its participants. Anthropologist 
Dr Lynne Hume (1997) reveals that many of the beliefs and activities of modern 
Pagans are similar to those of the seven groups, which increases the possibility that 
a few may occasionally levitate. For example, she writes that Neo-Pagans believe 
that by using ASCs it is possible to connect "psychically, with the energies around 
us. By focussing the mind, one can even become a human conduit for energy" 
(Hume, 1997, p.46). Pagans believe that magic is a natural phenomenon which 
can be achieved by concentrating on one's intuitive abilities and by manipulating 
psychic energy (p.66). Some Wiccans worship a God and Goddess although, like 
some Spiritualists, others see these as symbols of universal energy (p.69) with 
which one can learn to resonate. Advanced practitioners develop psi abilities such 
as clairvoyance, remote viewing and healing (Hume, 1997, p.133). 
Despite the possibility that the field may include genuine cases of levitation, 
witchcraft has not been included among the main seven groups because the 
reports are too scarce, possibly unreliable, and the literature contains so many 
contradictory claims. Nevertheless, witchcraft contains numerous similarities to the 


--- Page 206 ---

197 
seven groups: invisible spiritual powers and entities are often thought to cause psi 
events; historically there is a close link to spirit possession; witches supposedly 
have a variety of psi abilities similar to those found in shamanism; trances and 
ecstatic states are described; and for centuries witchcraft has been the subject of 
cruel and often violent taboos. 
7.4 Kundalini 
The concept of kundalini comes from Hinduism and yoga, but for some people in 
Western societies it is now seen as a phenomenon that transcends religious 
boundaries. Kundalini refers to a dormant spiritual energy that supposedly lies 
coiled at the base of the spine. It may awaken spontaneously or as a result of 
activities such as kundalini or tantric yoga, so, although it is an aspect of mysticism, 
it is being discussed here because it is regarded by many as a separate field. There 
are books devoted entirely to kundalini (eg: Woodroffe, 1919/1974), and there are 
several Internet sites that record people's kundalini experiences (eg: The Kundalini 
Research Network, 2004). Once awakened, kundalini energy rises up the spine 
through the chakras "and finds expression in the form of spiritual knowledge and 
mystical visions" (Friedrichs, 1999, p.190). The symptoms can vary enormously 
"and include bizarre physical sensations and movements, pain, clairaudience, 
visions, brilliant lights, superlucidity, psychical powers, ecstasy, bliss, and 
transcendence of self" (Guiley, 1991, p.319). Hinduism traditionally categorises 
the physical symptoms of rising kundalini in animal terms; one may experience a 
hopping frog-like movement in the spine (Johari, 1987, p.31) or a bird-like 
movement which involves "a feeling of levitation, lightness, weightlessness, or the 
feeling of a sweeping, nice floating movement is felt in the spine when the air 
element vayu is dominant" (p.32). As well as possibly producing psi powers, 
techniques to raise kundalini energy have similarities with advanced qigong, such 
as breath control, sexual abstinence and (for men) the attempt to raise their 
seminal essence to a higher chakra (Johari, 1987, p.29). Kundalini energy can 
supposedly move up the spine via two channels; the ida carries the lunar, feminine 
currents, and the pingala carries the solar, masculine energy (Johari, 1987, pp.26-
27), which resembles the division of chi into yin and yang energy. The similarities 
between chi, prana and kundalini suggest that they are different cultural 
descriptions of the same energy which, if managed appropriately, may facilitate 
human levitation. Guiley (1991, p.366) speculates that these energies may also be 
the equivalent to the magnetic fluid or force that Mesmer and his colleagues 


--- Page 207 ---

198 
claimed to work with. Dr William Tiller (1975, p.273) proposes that the chakras are 
the equivalent of transducers which have the potential to tap into cosmic power. 
Similarly, Swanson (2003) sees the chakras as "higher dimensional structures" 
which, when synchronized, may "form an even higher dimensional structure which 
can coordinate and access energy which is not normally available" (p.139). 
Leadbeater (1927/1994, p.18) believes that "certain European mystics were 
acquainted with the chakras". His evidence is a colour plate in a 1736 book by the 
German mystic Johan Gichtel which clearly shows all seven chakras. Guiley (1991) 
claims that "various examinations of mystical literature and traditions show that 
kundalini, known by various names, apparently has been a universal phenomenon 
in esoteric teachings for perhaps three thousand years" (p.320). She reports that 
since the 1970s there have been an increasing number of reports of kundalini 
awakenings in the West because descriptions of the phenomenon are readily 
available and more people are following various Eastern spiritual traditions (p.320). 
This accounts for Christina and Stanislav Grof (1991, pp.73 & 77) including 
kundalini awakening among their list of spontaneous spiritual emergencies. 
Leadbeater (1927/1994, p.81) warns that the premature awakening of kundalini 
can be dangerous, which is also the case when advanced neikung practitioners 
store chi in the dantien (Danaos, 2000, p.109), which equates to the third yoga 
chakra. The California psychiatrist Lee Sannella (1987) claims that, in an 
unprepared Westerner, the awakening of the kundalini can simulate medical 
problems such as psychosis, hysteria, heart attacks and gastrointestinal diseases. 
A search of the mailing list archives on the Kundalini Gateway (2004) website 
produces several references to personal experiences of levitation over the last few 
years. However, some discussion participants use the term levitation to refer to 
OBEs, some are discussing second-hand levitation reports and others are 
ambiguous or unwitnessed. For this reason I have not included kundalini among 
the seven groups although the field overlaps with mysticism, yoga and qigong and 
there is every possibility that some kundalini experiences have levitated. 
7.5 Mass Control and Excessive Gravitation. 
Murphy and White (1978) note that occasionally dancers and athletes such as 
basketball players appear to undergo "uncanny suspension" (p.101) whereby they 
stay in the air slightly longer than seems possible. Many athletes report feelings of 
peace, stillness, detachment and altered perceptions of time and bodily awareness 


--- Page 208 ---

199 
when they achieve their peak performances, which the authors believe is a mild and 
spontaneous version of the religious ecstasy that mystics experience when they 
levitate. Murphy and White (1978) suggest that "the discipline and training of sport 
and dance, plus situations calling for rising in the air - as in basketball, ballet and 
the broad jump — combined with conscious or unconscious breathing exercises, 
may trigger a rudimentary form of levitation" (p.104). 
Similarly, in his discussion of human levitation, Fodor (1933/1966) mentions the 
elevation of famous dancers (p.201) such as Maria Taglioni, Augustus Vestris, 
Vaslav Nijinsky and N.P. Damaschoff. He writes that "there is little doubt that the 
elevation of famous dancers demonstrates the rudimentaries of levitation" (p.201). 
Fodor claims that these dancers seemed able to hover in the air at the highest point 
of their jumps. Fodor (1964) notes that, although many people have commented 
on the height of Vaslav Nijinsky's leaps, "The greater mystery of remaining up and 
coming down slower than the law of gravitation would demand is passed over in 
silence by most of the writers" (p.23). Fodor interviewed Nijinsky's widow Romola, 
herself a dancer, who said that, when asked how he managed to stay up in the air, 
Nijinsky did not understand why others could not also do it. "He could control his 
descent, and could come down slower or quicker as he wished" (p.24). Nijinsky 
apparently inhaled before he jumped and only exhaled after he landed, which 
suggests that breath control was involved. Romola recalled that one of their 
children's governesses, who had worked in India, had told them about Hatha yoga, 
which led Nijinsky to become very interested in the subject. Romola explained that 
Nobody was allowed to enter his dressing room before the 
performance. No one could speak to him after he came out. He never 
answered. He looked, and acted, like a stranger. When once, in 
admiration, I told him what a pity it was that he could not see himself, 
he answered in all seriousness: "But I do. I always see myself. I am 
detached. I am outside. I make myself dance from the outside." (in 
Fodor, 1964, p.24) 
Fodor concludes that "there is a similarity between the psychic state of Nijinsky on 
the stage and the lung-gom-pa" (p.25). Ramola's evidence suggests that, by using 
breath control and ASCs, Nijinsky enhanced his natural dancing ability with a slight 
degree of levitation or mass control. 
In 1931 Captain J. Alleyne Bartlett is reported to have made himself several pounds 
lighter, using only his willpower, at a lecture to the London Spiritual Alliance (Melton, 
2001, p.916). Bartlett did not actually leave the ground, but his mass control ability 


--- Page 209 ---

200 
may be a precursor to levitation. Joseph Weed (1968, p.161) describes seeing a 
woman at an American fairground who used a weighing machine to show that she 
was 140 pounds [63.5 kg] but, after she stepped into a basket, Weed found that he 
could easily lift her with one hand. The woman claimed that both she and her 
mother had the same ability. She had never been able to levitate completely, but 
since she was a child she had at times felt very light and always floated down when 
she fell. Holding her hand over diaphragm she said "You can just make yourself 
feel lighter in here" (in Weed, 1968, p.161). This appears to be an example of 
inherited mass control ability, but the report does not explain why she pointed to 
her diaphragm. Although this spot is near the epigastrium and the third and fourth 
chakras, the woman may have meant that she could alter her weight by breath 
control. What distinguishes her from members of the seven groups is that she did 
not appear to have a belief system to explain her mass control ability, which would 
also probably mean that she had no literature on the subject, no exercises to 
perform, or role models apart from her mother. 
There may be a close link between mass control and excess gravitation (becoming 
so heavy that one cannot be moved) because they seem to occur to people from the 
same groups and sometimes in conjunction with levitation. For example, Melton 
(2001, p.910), quotes the example of the spirit medium Alberto Fontana "who, after 
a levitation, remained as if nailed to the floor, and nobody was able to move him". 
John Cornwell (1991) recounts an example from Garabandal. On one occasion, 
Conchita, one of the young girls, while in ecstasy, pleaded with some of the adults in 
her kitchen to lift her up because she could not reach "Our Lady's lips" (p.143). 
So three of us... attempted to lift her, but we could not raise her one 
millimetre from the floor; she was like a ton of rock. Jacinta Gonzalez 
Gonzalez, one of the other visionaries, was with her, and came forward 
after we had become exhausted with our efforts. Little Jacinta, who 
was just a slight child, lifted Conchita upwards with the tips of her 
fingers. She lifted her right up to the ceiling.... After Conchita had 
made the gesture of kissing her vision all of us saw her float back 
slowly, right back,... until she was absolutely horizontal. Jacinta 
brought her down holding only her legs. Then she let go of her legs and 
Conchita remained floating about a hand's height above the kitchen 
floor for several moments. We all stood absolutely amazed. I could 
have run my hand between the floor and her body, but I was rooted to 
the spot, (in Cornwall, 1991, p.143) 
The witness also explains that "while Conchita defied the laws of gravity, her dress 
was never in immodest disarray" (p.143), which matches other descriptions of 
levitating women. These reports seem to suggest that the same energy or spiritual 


--- Page 210 ---

201 
power is involved in excessive gravitation, mass control and levitation, which 
challenges the theory that levitation is produced by a force that annuls gravity, 
because at times it appears to enhance it. 
i 
7.6 The Lifting Game 
Descriptions of the lifting game involve a variety of techniques. The most common 
is that four standing people lift a seated subject by putting both forefingers, or the 
first two fingers of one hand, under the subject's knees and armpits. This means 
that the subject is being raised by a total of eight fingers, which sceptics claim is 
sufficient to lift the average person, thus supposedly excluding any psi explanation 
for the sitter's apparent loss of weight. A variation is that, before lifting, the sitters 
put their hands on the subject's head and push downwards. Although it is not full 
levitation, unless a better explanation is found, the lifting game may be a form of 
mass control. Richard LeFors Clark (2004) provides a complex technique which he 
terms "human diamagnetism antenna levitation". He claims that, for maximum 
effectiveness, the four lifters must include two males and two females and must 
stand diagonally opposite each other at 45 degrees off magnetic north, south, east 
and west. Before they lift, they must stack their hands alternately on the subject's 
head so that no one has both hands touching each other and each hand only 
touches that of the opposite sex. Exerting a steady downwards pressure, they must 
count to ten and then quickly lift the sitter using the first finger of each hand under 
the knees and arms. He asserts that without first putting their hands on the 
subject's head the lift will be impossible. Clark does not document any experiments 
to confirm this claim, and different procedures described by other lifting game 
participants suggest that he is mistaken. 
Amanda (personal communication, 14 July 2003) claims that when she was ten she 
frequently participated in the lifting game in the school playground. After lying flat 
on the floor, "I would put myself into a trance-like state of relaxation where I 
imagined that I was dying". The six lifters would each chant "You are injured" 
followed by "You are sick," "You are dying" and "You are dead". They would then 
together chant "On the count often we will raise your body up from the dead unto 
the heavens and your soul will rise up". Amanda reports that "By the time they had 
counted to ten, I could feel my soul leave my body and I felt as light as air. When I 
opened my eyes and realised I was off the ground to about waist to shoulder height 
I would come back down with a bump". Amanda says that, because her body 


--- Page 211 ---

202 
became so light, the six lifters (one at her head and feet and two on each side) were 
only using their fingers to guide her body as it levitated into the air. They tried to lift 
other girls but only succeeded with Amanda. She says that when she opened her 
eyes to see what was happening, she would drop back to the ground because "the 
connection of the energy state I was in became broken". A sceptic might claim that 
the memories of an entranced ten-year-old with closed eyes should not be trusted. 
Although not a clear example of levitation, Amanda reveals similarities with other 
levitators. She describes an ASC; she says that she has had psi abilities from 
childhood; she is currently involved in spiritual healing (personal communication, 16 
July 2003); and claims guidance and visitations from angelic beings; all of which 
might explain why her peers could lift her but not others. Amanda's claim that she 
could feel her soul leave her body may also explain Stern's claim that the Russians 
call levitation 'partial death' (in Hasted, 1981, p.201), and the report of a woman's 
body becoming extremely light shortly after she died (in Spees, 2001, p.272). 
Some researchers assert that breathing exercises produce the weight loss during 
the lifting game. The psychical researcher Dr Hereward Carrington conducted 
experiments where he put four lifters and a seated subject onto a large scale. The 
technique required the lifters to "bend forward several times in unison, inhaling and 
exhaling deeply together. The person seated in the chair also inhales and exhales 
at the same time. On the fifth count all five persons hold their breath" and the 
seated person is lifted (in Fodor, 1933/1966, p.37). Although the combined weight 
of the lifters, chair and subject was 712 pounds [323 kg], on each of five 
successive lifts, a weight loss of between 50 and 60 pounds [23-27 kg] was 
recorded (p.37). The weight loss "slowly returned to normal as the subject was held 
for some considerable time in the air" (in Fodor, 1933/1966, p.37). Apart from the 
suggestion of mass control, no conventional scientific explanation has been 
proposed for the lifting game. Why would the lifters breathing in unison help reduce 
the sitter's weight in Carrington's experiment, or did both the lifters and sitter briefly 
lose weight? It might be helpful if the experiment was repeated with each person's 
weight being recorded separately to see precisely what happens. 
Dr Thelma Moss (1997) has included the lifting game in several of her 
parapsychology classes and reports that "the success of the experiment is in the 
rhythm with which these simple movements are carried out" (p.125). Initially Moss 
requires the lifters to put their hands on the sitter's head before they lift, but claims 


--- Page 212 ---

203 
that once they have established a good rhythm, this procedure can be discarded. 
"All that seems necessary is for the four persons to chant a phrase in unison five or 
six times. Any phrase will do, provided it is done in rhythm" (p.125). This suggests 
that for some reason the physical and psychological coordination of the lifters is 
essential. A concept called 'brain coherence' put forward by some 
parapsychologists to help explain PK may also apply to the lifting game. Brain 
coherence means that "the firings of the billions of neurones in the brain occur 
more 'in step' with one another" (Swanson, 2003, p.269), thus significantly 
increasing the power of whatever they are doing. Coherence is also linked to the 
idea that the mind can somehow transcend the physical brain and access a non-
local realm of consciousness and energy. Lynne McTaggart (2001) uses the term 
zero point field to describe this realm in which energy and consciousness appear to 
merge. Once again, this concept is an updated version of what yogis and mystics 
have been saying for thousands of years: that, at the deepest level, consciousness 
and the fundamental nature of reality are one. Laboratory research into PK abilities 
appears to reveal that people who are bonded in some way (such as couples) can 
produce a more powerful combined PK effect than the sum of their individual 
abilities (McTaggart, 2001, p.156). Although this does not explain how levitation or 
mass control works, it suggests that brain coherence is produced by the ritual 
nature of the lifting game. By simultaneously breathing, chanting and/or putting 
their hands on the sitter's head in unison, the lifters may achieve a level of 
consciousness coherence that they cannot reach individually, and this may briefly 
cause their combined PK abilities to reduce the subject's weight. In Amanda's 
case, her psi abilities combined with the lifters' chanting may have produced 
sufficient weight loss for her to almost levitate. Perhaps people with psi powers can 
achieve a significant level of brain coherence more easily than others. Certain ASCs 
may facilitate brain coherence, which might explain why so many levitators do so 
while in religious ecstasy. The fact that the lifting game seems to depend on 
cumulative group coherence produced by the rhythm of the lifters suggests that the 
force that facilitates psi phenomena is universal and can transcend the individual 
mind. Although this may begin to explain what is happening in the brains of people 
who levitate, it does not explain exactly what PK energy is or how it works. 
7.7 Transcendental Meditation (TM) 
Because of the publicity it has received in previous years, a link between 
Transcendental Meditation (TM) and levitation, or at least hopping while sitting 


--- Page 213 ---

204 
cross-legged, exists in the minds of many Westerners. Although they have been 
largely secularised, most of the beliefs and practices of TM derive from Hindu and 
yogic traditions and are closely linked to the breathing exercises and mantra 
repetition of pranayama. As Richards (1980, p.81) points out, many ancient Indian 
texts explain that pranayama practitioners will experience several stages of 
development. The first involves perspiration; at the second stage the body may 
tremble; and at the third it may start hopping or jumping about like a frog; once this 
stage is mastered, levitation may follow. The symptoms of stage two may vary 
considerably and, according to Richards (1980, p.83), are actually a sign that one's 
kundalini is awakening. Part of the TM-Sidhi course, which has been available to 
practitioners since 1976, includes what is called 'yogic flying' which has three 
stages: "Stage One is generally associated with what would be best described as 
'hopping like a frog'. Stage Two is flying through the air fcr a short time. Stage 
Three is complete mastery of the sky" (Wuebben & Wuebben, 2004). Since it 
commenced, the TM-Sidhi course has caused some controversy because, although 
it is claimed that over 100,000 people have attended and there have been several 
media demonstrations of stage one, no one has publicly revealed their capacity to 
levitate. A few participants have sued the TM organisation because they did not 
learn to levitate despite the high cost of the course. Nevertheless, the organisation 
claims to have comprehensively researched yogic flying and has published a lot of 
information about its supposed connection to consciousness. 
Although it does not show anyone levitating, the TM video Yogic Flying (n.d.) shows 
several practitioners bouncing along on mattresses with their legs in the lotus 
position. They are obviously some of TM's most agile 'flyers', and the apparent 
ease with which they hop suggests that mass control may be involved. In the video, 
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi explains that the "bubbling bliss" that the flyers experience 
as they hop along is because their brains are in a state of increased coherence 
which enables them to experience "transcendental consciousness". The Maharishi 
asserts that the "managing intelligence of the universe" which he also calls "the 
unified field" lies within everyone and, once accessed, can enable advanced 
practitioners to do almost anything. In an interdisciplinary TM journal, Dr John 
Hagelin (1987), the Professor of Physics at Maharishi International University (now 
Maharishi University of Management), acknowledges that 
Certain sidhis, for instance levitation, appear to violate the classical 
laws of Newtonian gravity and general relativity, which at first sight 


--- Page 214 ---

205 
would seem highly implausible. However, neither Newtonian gravity nor 
general relativity represent consistent theories of gravity from a 
quantum-mechanical standpoint, and it might become necessary to 
reassess the circumstances under which these classical theories can 
be expected to apply. (Hagelin, 1987, p.79) 
As a solution to this problem, Hagelin suggests that 
The phenomenon of levitation, with its implied control over the local 
curvature of space-time geometry, would appear to require the ability to 
function coherently at the scale of quantum gravity, which is the 
assumed scale of the super-unification and the proposed domain of 
pure consciousness. In this way some of the sidhis, if demonstrated 
under laboratory conditions, would provide striking evidence for the 
proposed identity between pure consciousness and the unified field. 
(Hagelin, 1987, p.80) 
In a more recent TM video on the physics of flying, Hagelin (1996) expands on these 
ideas to explain how psi phenomena such as human levitation work. He claims that 
there exists a link between the quantum scale of reality and pure consciousness, 
which can be reached through deep meditation. Hagelin asserts that the classical 
laws of nature, such as gravity, are not absolute but are statistical laws based on 
deeper quantum mechanical principles. The microscopic controls the macroscopic, 
so, once one has accessed the level of consciousness that equates to the unified 
field, one's intention or willpower can tip the statistical balance and produce 
seemingly miraculous results. Gravity has to be changed at the microscopic level 
because it is only there that it is united with other forces within the unified field 
(Hagelin, 1996), which may be another term for what others call the zero point field. 
Hagelin's assertions about a link between consciousness and the unified field seem 
to be an updated version of the ubiquitous mystical claim that consciousness 
underlies the whole of physical reality. But, although the existence of PK 
phenomena suggests that these claims may be true, the empirical evidence linking 
mind and matter is still disputed by most scientists, and, while physicists may be 
looking for a unified field or theory of everything (TOE), they do not yet seem to have 
found one. So, to explain yogic flying, Hagelin is linking two popular but as yet 
unconfirmed scientific ideas. It is also puzzling that none of the many TM-Sidhi 
practitioners seem to have progressed to the levitation stage. If any of them did 
levitate, the evidence suggests that the TM organisation would be keen to publicise 
such an achievement. For example, although the term 'flying' is an exaggeration, 
an article in the Des Moines Register (Pierre, 2003) describes 


--- Page 215 ---

206 
the high drama of the yogic flying competition, which took place ... in 
the Golden Dome at the Maharishi University of Management in 
Fairfield. Organizers said it was the first public competition of its kind 
in 10 years. The 14 male participants maxed out at about 2.5-foot [76 
cm] heights and 5.5-foot [1.68 m] distances, and accomplished 25-
metre dashes as fast as 14 seconds, all while hopping from a full-lotus 
position. (Pierre, 2003) 
Despite this publicity, it is possible that TM yogic flying does not lead to human 
levitation, or perhaps the organisation is cautious about encouraging its 
practitioners to progress to this level because of the link between kundalini arousal, 
hopping and levitation. As mentioned earlier, the awakening of kundalini can be 
erratic, unpredictable and sometimes dangerous, unless the practitioner has the 
strength and clarity to control it (Leadbeater, 1927/1994, p.30). Another possibility 
is that the TM organisation has its own taboos against revealing that some of its 
advanced practitioners can genuinely levitate. An experienced Australian TM 
practitioner claims that, after meditating for about twenty years, 
[I] started to experience rushes of energy up my spine during periods of 
transcendence in meditation. These progressed until my body began to 
lift off the bed (I usually meditate sitting up at the head of my bed). 
Nowadays, in just about every meditation, my body lifts off the bed two 
to three times. It feels like a distance of ten to twenty centimetres 
(judging by the thump I make on the bed covers). It's basically straight 
up and down. I don't think I'm suspended very long. Various members 
of my family have witnessed me, and one time I broke the base of the 
bed when I landed. (Personal communication, 1 February 2004) 
This suggests that some advanced TM meditators may experience what seems to 
be the beginning of levitation in association with kundalini awakening, but, until 
evidence of genuine levitation is produced, the link between levitation and TM 
remains hypothetical. Nevertheless, TM has similar features to the seven groups. 
Their beliefs and meditation practices are a form of secularised mysticism which 
involves ASCs, and, although their levitation claims appear to be exaggerated, some 
mass control seems to be involved. TM's claims about a link between brain 
coherence and psi phenomena such as levitation reflect the beliefs of some 
parapsychologists but, given the number of enthusiastic subjects in the 
organisation, it is puzzling that they appear to do so little scientific research into PK. 
7.8 Chapter Summary 
Most of the groups discussed in this chapter are closely connected to each other 
and the major themes. For example, witchcraft is often linked to spirit possession 
and many of its techniques and beliefs are thought to derive from shamanism. 


--- Page 216 ---

207 
ASCs and breathing techniques seem to be involved in the levitation or mass control 
experienced by a few ballet dancers, the lifting game, lung-gom and in hypnosis, 
mesmerism and animal magnetism. Transcendental Meditation (TM) is related to 
kundalini, and its hopping and levitation techniques derive from Hindu and yoga 
traditions. This seems to reveal that almost all instances of human levitation 
require that the levitator either has latent psi abilities, and/or is involved in ASCs, 
breath control, or interactions with spiritual entities. Several of the groups 
mentioned in this chapter, such as lung-gom, mass control, the lifting game and TM 
show that, although levitators are very rare, there is a significant number of other 
people who seem to almost levitate. Although there is no guarantee that all these 
activities are precursors to levitation, they may be worth investigating in case they 
are. For example, researching the lifting game, which uses normal people as 
sitters, would probably be much easier than finding a levitator to study.

Chapter 8 
Conclusion. 
Research goals and methodology. The fact that no modern scientific investigation 
of human levitation appears to have been published suggests that most scientists 
do not regard the phenomenon as real, probably because it seems to contradict the 
basic laws of physics. However, in my opinion the anecdotal evidence suggests that 
levitation does exist, and other evidence suggests that some benefits might flow 
from discovering how it works. Parapsychologists classify levitation as a form of PK 
and would prefer to study it in a laboratory, which would be difficult to achieve 
because the phenomenon is generally described as rare, unpredictable and 
involuntary. In an attempt to overcome some of these research obstacles this 
qualitative research project is designed as a precursor to a parapsychology 
investigation, and its methodology reflects the three basic concerns of that 
discipline, which Irwin (2004, p.7) claims are authenticity, underlying process and 
phenomenology. As stated in the Introduction (Chapter 1), when applied to human 
levitation, authenticity is about whether there are any grounds for believing that the 
phenomenon is genuine. Underlying process seeks evidence that might explain 
how levitation works, and the phenomenology component asks levitators and 
witnesses what the experience of levitation is like. As Irwin (2004) writes, 
"phenomenological research is useful in generating hypotheses for investigation in 
process-oriented research" (p.8). 
Instead of disregarding the gradually increasing historical collection of human 
levitation reports, as the scientific community is doing, and without attempting to 
prove that individual cases are genuine, this research project has sought 
information about the nature of the phenomenon by looking at the body of levitation 
reports as a whole. This data may help persuade empirical researchers to take the 
scientific anomaly of human levitation more seriously; it may assist them in finding 
people who levitate, as well as generating some useful research hypotheses. 
1) The primary component is a thematic comparison of historical and modern 
human levitation reports, and of the seven groups that have traditionally produced 
them, to see what major physical, cultural and phenomenological circumstances the 
levitators and their groups have in common, because this information may 
strengthen the case for authenticity and help future researchers investigate the 
underlying process questions. Interviews have been conducted with a selection of 


--- Page 218 ---

209 
people from three of the groups: some Christian priests and pastors, Spiritualists 
and qigong instructors have been asked whether they have experienced or 
witnessed levitation and what their opinions are about its causes. Some people 
who claim to have levitated have also been interviewed. Information from some of 
these interviews has been used to enhance both the thematic comparison and the 
hypothesis-generation exercise. 
2) The second component is a hypothesis-generating exercise; if the phenomenon 
is genuine, the circumstances, beliefs and explanations surrounding traditional 
levitation reports might help explain what causes or facilitates it. The suggestions 
and observations made in this section focus primarily on possible links between 
some current parapsychological theories, the nature of consciousness, especially 
ASCs, and whatever energy might be involved in psi phenomena such as human 
levitation. It is hoped that this information will assist future parapsychology 
investigators to research levitation from a more empirical perspective. 
8.1 Thematic Comparison. 
The five major themes that are documented in the preceding chapters are so 
closely connected that at times they are hard to distinguish from one another. They 
are: a belief in spirits and spirit realms; a belief in spirit possession; the experience 
of altered states of consciousness (ASCs) and breath control; reports of levitators' 
other psi abilities; and group or religious taboos and obstacles against developing, 
displaying, or investigating psi abilities. These themes seem to be the most 
relevant to an investigation of human levitation because they are the main 
similarities between the groups that traditionally produce these reports, and they 
are largely about hypothesised spiritual powers that most of the groups believe can 
facilitate psi events. 
Spirits and Spirit Realms. Most members of the seven groups believe that various 
types of spiritual entities exist, such as spirits of the dead, gods, demi-gods, angels, 
demons, or inter-dimensional beings. Sometimes— especially in qigong —spiritual 
powers are perceived not as personal entities but as impersonal energies such as 
chi or prana. Some mystics claim that it is possible for the mind to create 
independent or semi-independent spiritual entities, such as Tibetan tulpas. Spirit 
realms are invisible to the normal person; they have no precise geographical 
location but are generally claimed to interpenetrate physical reality in a multi-


--- Page 219 ---

210 
dimensional manner. All the groups attribute divine, magical, or psi abilities to 
spiritual entities or powers and treat them with great reverence or, in the case of 
demons, attempt to banish or avoid them. Similarly, some abductees are fearful of 
aliens — whom they may regard as spiritual entities — although others welcome 
their attention. In all seven groups, the power of spiritual entities or energy is the 
most common explanation for spontaneous or involuntary human levitation, 
although some members claim that with sufficient meditative training one can learn 
to levitate voluntarily by accessing this power oneself without the assistance of 
spirits. Whether couched in personal (eg: spirits) or impersonal (eg: chi) terms, this 
first theme is the most popular way to explain how levitation works, and the 
subsequent four themes are dependent on the apparent existence of the psi 
powers that originate from these hypothesised spiritual realms. The primary 
question that this theme raises is whether there really exists an invisible, multi-
dimensional realm that is somehow linked to consciousness and which contains 
discarnate entities and/or powers which at times facilitate psi events. It seems 
unlikely that all seven groups would invent a similar explanation for levitation if it 
was completely untrue. A second question is whether this explanation largely just 
replaces one mystery with another. 
Spirit Possession. Members of these groups engage in activities such as prayer, 
contemplation, meditation, or trances that they hope will bring them closer to 
spiritual beings or powers. This may be done to seek protection, spiritual guidance, 
clairvoyant information, contact with the dead, improved martial arts abilities, or psi 
results such as healing. To varying degrees these activities lead practitioners to 
claim that spiritual entities can intrude into or completely take over their 
consciousness, although many modern researchers believe that these are merely 
psychological disturbances. In some, such as spirit mediums and shamans, this 
intrusion may be voluntary and temporary, but in spirit possession, poltergeist 
activity and some abductions it is involuntary and difficult to stop. Levitation and 
other psi events may occasionally occur during voluntary or involuntary spirit 
possession. As an extension of the first theme, the possession theme is believed to 
explain some levitations and suggests that consciousness interfaces the 
hypothesised spirit realm, although claiming that spiritual entities cause levitation 
explains little about how levitation works. Within most of the seven groups there is 
evidence that practitioners who are highly trained in their group's conceptual map 
of these realms are the least likely to become involuntarily possessed and the most 


--- Page 220 ---

211 
likely to be able to levitate at will, which again suggests a link between 
consciousness and psi abilities. 
Altered States of Consciousness and Breath Control. It seems that everyone who 
levitates does so while in some form of ASC, such as trance or religious ecstasy. 
ASCs may vary significantly among the groups; a mystic may sit impassively in deep 
meditation, whereas entranced shamans can display intense physical activity and 
psi abilities that are completely different from their normal behaviour. Among those 
that employ the technique, breath control is frequently used to enter ASCs and is 
believed to assist in accessing universal or life energies, such as prana or chi which, 
like spirits, are claimed to facilitate psi abilities. Like the theme of spirit possession, 
this third theme of ASCs and breath control is linked to a belief in spirit realms 
because many group members believe that certain ASCs enable one to access 
these realms and the powers or entities they contain. The ASC theme is only 
partially explanatory because, although almost all levitators enter ASCs, these 
states are not seen as the cause of levitation but as a means of accessing its 
cause(s) which are believed to be spirits or spiritual energies. Because 
consciousness and ASCs are already the subject of several academic disciplines, 
from a scientific perspective this theme may perhaps be the most fruitful one from 
which to research levitation. Although they are uncertain about the reason, 
parapsychologists are aware of a correlation between ASCs and psi events (Radin, 
1997, p.105). Science has only a limited understanding of the nature of human 
consciousness, nevertheless this theme, like the previous two, suggests a link 
between psi abilities such as levitation and what appear to be transpersonal 
dimensions of the mind. 
Levitators' Other Paranormal Abilities. Within the seven groups there is a small 
number of people who seem to have a remarkable range of psi abilities in addition 
to the ability to levitate. These include healing, fire invulnerability, clairvoyance, 
teleportation, radiance, weather control and extrasensory interaction with animals. 
There are no psi abilities that are exclusive to any one of the groups. This seems to 
confirm that some aspect of the groups' members' behaviour triggers or enhances 
psi abilities and that these powers are not culturally dependent: they cross 
geographical and religious boundaries with ease, although useful abilities such as 
healing are more prevalent than less productive ones like levitation. The young age 
at which some people develop psi abilities suggests that they may have a genetic 


--- Page 221 ---

212 
component. Not all group members welcome all psi events; demonic spirit 
possession and poltergeist activity are certainly not sought after, although shamans 
and mediums often seek a variety of psi powers. There often seems to be a 
complex, human-like intelligence behind psi abilities, especially in cases of 
poltergeist activity, which appears to strengthen the suggestion of a link between 
these abilities and consciousness. This fourth theme is closely linked to the 
previous themes. Group members generally propose the same explanations for 
other psi abilities as they do for levitation and these abilities can overlap or occur 
simultaneously which suggests that at some level they may be powered by the 
same energy. Learning how one psi ability works may therefore help explain some 
of the others. 
Taboos and Obstacles. Most of the seven groups have either longstanding or 
more recent cultural taboos against developing and demonstrating psi abilities. 
There are also numerous practical difficulties that researchers need to overcome if 
they wish to investigate these abilities. These result largely from the fact that psi 
abilities are so often unpredictable, involuntary apd supposedly caused by invisible 
entities. Most religions accept that some advanced mystics have healing or other 
psi abilities that they claim are divinely inspired, but, with little justification, they 
tend to demonise reports of similar abilities from members of other groups. This 
fifth theme is the most varied among the seven groups - for example Spiritualists 
may seek psi powers while mystics do not — and does not reveal very much about 
how levitation works. But most of the taboos against developing or displaying psi 
powers have a religious origin, which implies that in those circles it has long been 
known that activities such as meditation and ASCs will produce psi abilities in some 
practitioners that may subvert their spiritual progress or produce unfavourable 
publicity. This appears to strengthen both the probability that psi abilities such as 
levitation exist and that they are linked to consciousness. It also links the taboo 
theme to the previous four themes and suggests that there may be more people 
who can levitate voluntarily than the groups have traditionally acknowledged. 
Almost Levitating. The miscellaneous groups discussed in Chapter 7 either 
produce levitation reports (eg: animal magnetism) or something that seems directly 
related to it, such as lung-gom or the lifting game. The fact that these other groups 
display similar themes to the seven major groups supports the relevance of the five 
themes to a study of human levitation and again strengthens the authenticity 


--- Page 222 ---

213 
argument. Given the difficulty parapsychologists would probably have in finding 
levitators to study, these miscellaneous groups offer several helpful research 
approaches to what seem to be precursors to levitation. 
Summary. Although the thematic comparison cannot verify any particular levitation 
report, as is argued in the next section (8.2), the range of similarities between the 
reports strengthens the probability that the phenomenon is genuine. There appear 
to be two main variable factors in levitation cases. These are whether they are 
voluntary or involuntary in nature, and whether the levitator hovers in one place or 
flies through the air. Joseph of Cupertino did both on different occasions. Some 
people from groups such as shamanism, qigong and mysticism appear able to 
levitate at will, while people who are supposedly possessed by demonic entities, 
those affected by poltergeist activity and most alien abductees, appear to have no 
control over their levitations and are often thrown through the air. Some 
Spiritualists who levitate appear to have a slight amount of control while others 
have no control, whether they hover or fly a trajectory. People who are levitated by 
others generally hover. Another feature involves demoniacs being involuntarily 
levitated upside down without their clothes falling down. 
The thematic comparison suggests that, from a future research perspective, the link 
between human levitation and ASCs is the most important similarity between the 
groups. Everyone who levitates appears to do so while in an ASC. Some may be in 
a deep trance while others may be in such a shallow trance that witnesses do not 
realise it. People who are levitated by others always seem to be in a trance. 
Further research into human consciousness and the ASCs that levitators experience 
seems to be an important pathway to investigate how levitation works. To varying 
degrees, all the groups believe that ASCs enable people to access spiritual realms 
containing entities and/or powers that can transcend the known laws of physics. 
This suggests that the empirical sciences need to continue the investigation into 
whether there is an unknown, transpersonal force that links some aspect of human 
consciousness and physical reality. 
8.2 Hypothesis Generation. 
With a subject as baffling as human levitation, a qualitative hypothesis-generating 
exercise should ideally produce several ideas which may be relevant to further 
research. The anecdotal evidence of authenticity suggests that human levitation 


--- Page 223 ---

214 
warrants further research. The other ideas discussed in this section have been 
chosen for several reasons. Firstly, issues such as PK, consciousness and spirits 
seem relevant because they are frequently mentioned during the thematic 
comparison. This does not guarantee that these topics will eventually explain 
human levitation, but it would be unwise to ignore them at this stage. Secondly, 
some of the topics to be discussed below (eg: brain coherence and zero point 
energy) are already being investigated by the empirical sciences, and are linked by 
some parapsychologists to psi events. There is little point in producing a research 
hypothesis that is so vague that it merely replaces one mystery with another and 
offers no starting point for a laboratory investigation, but, as most researchers 
know, many historical discoveries started off as little more than tentative ideas, so 
some issues raised in this section are somewhat speculative. Another problem is 
terminology: as the thematic comparison reveals, different groups use different 
terms to describe what may be the same phenomena, whereas empirical 
researchers often prefer to use words with few historical or religious connotations. 
At times this can cause confusion. For example, are those who personify (eg: 
spirits) describing the same thing as those who do not (eg: chi)? While discussing 
the hypotheses in this section it is assumed that some of the terms used by 
scientists, and in the groups' explanations for psi events, may be describing the 
same phenomena from a different perspective. 
Authenticity of Levitation. Speaking of PK in general, Irwin (2004) claims that 
"the consistencies in spontaneous PK case reports do testify to the authenticity of 
this parapsychological phenomenon" (p.107), but, in his opinion, they do not 
constitute proof. The research in this thesis cannot verify the reality of human 
levitation, largely because, as parapsychologists such as Irwin claim, this can only 
be done in a laboratory. However, because there are marked similarities between 
the circumstances, beliefs and explanations surrounding levitation reports from the 
seven groups, it seems reasonable to suggest that the phenomenon is genuine. In 
other words, although it is not conclusive, the authenticity evidence now seems 
strong enough to justify further scientific research into the subject. Given that the 
cases in this study cover a time span of nearly two thousand years, and have 
originated from a variety of cultures and locations, the most likely explanation for 
their thematic similarities is that these levitators and witnesses are describing the 
same physical phenomenon. Minor differences in beliefs about the causes of 
levitation can be explained by varying cultural influences, but descriptions of the 


--- Page 224 ---

215 
phenomenon and the circumstances under which it occurs appear to remain 
reasonably consistent. If these people have been falsifying levitation reports for 
some reason or have all been deluded, it seems unlikely that there would be such 
similarities in their descriptions and explanations. 
A sceptic might claim that, in order to seem convincing, people falsifying levitation 
reports have copied them from other groups. Members of all seven groups attempt 
to interact with unseen spiritual powers that can supposedly facilitate psi abilities, 
but most of them have taboos about developing and displaying these abilities, so 
why would they make up psi reports that seem to break those taboos? It is equally 
unlikely that similar levitation reports are the product of mistaken observations 
because human levitation is so different from other physical activities. It is difficult 
to mistakenly observe a person hovering half a metre off the ground, which Leroy 
(1928, p. 180) claims is the height of the average levitation. Leroy (p.184) also 
notes that most levitations last for several minutes and that Joseph of Cupertino 
and some others were reported to have remained in the air for over an hour. These 
heights and durations provide ample opportunity for witnesses to observe the 
phenomena. As mentioned previously (Section 4.7), Sister Anne testified that she 
observed Teresa of Avila levitate in religious ecstasy about 50 cm off the ground for 
half an hour and that she passed her hands under Teresa's feet (in Leroy, 1928, 
p.72). If all levitation reports are delusional, surely they would vary considerably 
more than they do and would not be as confined to members of the seven groups. 
Mental illness is not limited to these groups, so there would be people from all 
walks of life making delusional levitation claims, but I have not found any such 
reports. If the reports are produced by spiritual groups attempting to prove that 
their gods are more powerful, the levitation descriptions would over the centuries 
probably have become increasingly exaggerated, which is not the case. Despite the 
extraordinary nature of the phenomenon, the most likely explanation for the 
thematic consistency of the world-wide body of levitation reports is that genuine psi 
events are being described. 
Causes of Levitation. Out of the general population this research has narrowed 
down those who levitate to seven main groups and a small number of 
miscellaneous ones, and has shown that they have several themes in common. In 
seeking further information from the thematic comparison we can ask what it is that 
distinguishes levitators from other members of their groups. If their beliefs and 


--- Page 225 ---

216 
spiritual activities trigger human levitation, why do the other members not levitate? 
Leroy (1928, p.187) says that no more than four percent of Christian saints are 
reported to have levitated. So what causes them to levitate and not their 
colleagues? Going one step further, we can ask why it is that levitators do it so 
infrequently. For example, Leroy (1928) calculates that over thirty-five years the 
average frequency of Joseph of Cupertino's levitations was about three times a year 
(p.187). Most other levitators only do so once or twice in a lifetime. Even if these 
low frequencies are partially the result of religious taboos against displaying psi 
abilities, what caused Joseph and others to levitate on those occasions but not at 
other times? The dominant themes that distinguish the seven groups from the 
public at large are a belief in and an attempt to get to know, to interact with, to tap 
into, to merge, or resonate with unknown spiritual powers which some members 
personify and others do not. The most common way of doing this is by entering 
voluntary or involuntary ASCs, and almost all levitators do so while in these states. 
Given that parapsychologists accept thai there is a correlation between ASCs and 
psi events, it seems probable that what distinguishes levitators from other 
members of their groups is a rare combination of three factors: a belief in spiritual 
entities or powers; physical activities such as prayer, meditation, or seances; and 
certain ASCs. There is a difference, however, between whatever might cause 
levitation and its actual mechanism. For example, if an entranced physical medium 
successfully requests to be levitated by a spirit, we can conclude that that 
behaviour caused the levitation, but, from an empirical perspective, it does not 
prove that spirits exist; it does not explain the force or energy that lifts the person 
into the air; and it does not eliminate the possibility that other levitations may occur 
under different circumstances. But, whatever the mechanism or force, the 
evidence suggests that it is reasonable to conclude that ASCs and communicating 
with or tapping into spiritual powers are activities that significantly increase the 
probability of levitation. Heath (2003, p.21), too, concludes that "an altered state 
of consciousness (ASC) seems to be a helpful/and perhaps necessary, condition" 
for levitation. 
The spirit medium example above illustrates the difference between external and 
internal activities. The thematic comparison refers to spiritual beliefs, physical 
activities and internal states such as ASCs. Some of these, such as seances or 
meditation, can be observed, but do not reveal the precise nature of a person's 
ASC. For example, two Buddhist monks could be seen meditating in an identical 


--- Page 226 ---

217 
fashion, yet a recording of their brain activities may reveal that one spends more 
time at a lower brain frequency than the other. But this method of observation has 
its limitations. Even if the monks' brain frequencies did match, there could be other 
aspects of their ASCs which science cannot yet detect. The evidence from levitators 
such as Home and some of the interviewees suggests that inherited abilities may 
assist some people to levitate, perhaps by enabling them to enter an appropriate 
ASC more easily. The existence of these unobservable internal factors implies that, 
although one can conclude that certain beliefs and physical activities increase the 
likelihood of levitation, there are probably other important consciousness criteria 
which we can only speculate about at this stage. 
The capacity to enter certain ASCs, therefore, seems to be the most likely 
explanation for such a small percentage of the groups' members levitating, despite 
many of them having the same spiritual beliefs and regularly carrying out the same 
physical activities. Leroy (1928) quotes a claim by Dr Imbert-Gourbeyre that "only 
500 members of the Franciscan Order have experienced ecstasy in the course of 
the last five centuries - that is, about 1 in 6,000" (p.187). Most mystics levitate 
during religious ecstasy, but this does not guarantee that it will happen to everyone 
in this type of ASC. The Tibetan lama who Chatterjee (1887, p.727) saw 
deliberately levitating after meditating for an hour illustrates this point. Millions of 
people frequently meditate, but how many of them ever levitate? We can speculate 
that, to be able to levitate, the lama, as well as possibly having a suitable genetic 
predisposition, had undergone sufficient meditative training to be able to achieve a 
level of consciousness that generates or resonates with a non-local energy that can 
levitate him. Some people in ASCs may accidentally achieve this state of 
consciousness and involuntarily levitate for a brief time without realising why it 
occurred, but it is probable that most people's ASCs are not sufficiently focussed or 
coherent to produce this psi energy, even if they do know that it exists. The internal 
spectrum of ASCs appears to be so wide and varied that it is probable that the 
consciousness state that facilitates levitation is rarely accessed successfully. When 
one adds in the taboos against developing and demonstrating psi abilities, the 
understandable fear that spontaneous levitation can produce, and its lack of social 
or practical application, it is not surprising that so few people levitate. So, the seven 
group's thematic similarities suggest that, not only is levitation probably authentic, 
but it also seems reasonable to believe that some aspects of their members' 


--- Page 227 ---

218 
behaviour cause it to occur, and that the most likely candidate is certain voluntary 
or involuntary ASCs. 
Levitation Energy. If human levitation does exist, it seems to use a force that is 
accessible during certain ASCs and which can be reached more easily with practice. 
Science claims that there only exist four fundamental energies: the strong and the 
waak nuclear forces, electromagnetism and gravity. It is unclear whether levitation 
uses one or more of these forces or an unknown force. It seems unlikely that 
levitation is just the result of gravity being nullified, because that would only enable 
the person to be weightless, like astronauts in space, whereas most levitators hover 
in a fixed position and others fly meaningful trajectories or levitate other people off 
the ground with them. This implies that whatever causes human levitation has a 
variable propulsion force that is linked to consciousness and/or has an intelligence 
of its own. Spiritualists believe that levitation is facilitated by spirits, but this does 
not always seem to be the case. As mentioned previously (Section 5.2), sometimes 
the temperature in a seance room drops significantly before a PK event such as 
levitation, which could mean that heat is somehow being converted into psi energy. 
Spirits may be doing this, although at present science cannot explain it. Those who 
levitate voluntarily appear to use ASCs to control impersonal spiritual forces such as 
chi. Some qigong practitioners claim that to levitate one needs appropriate 
amounts of yin and yang chi, and they link heat with yang chi. Yin chi can 
supposedly be accumulated via meditation or obtained from a spirit, so whether it is 
controlled by human consciousness or a spirit seems irrelevant because the energy 
may be the same. 
Some psi events seem to involve a form of electromagnetism. Chi has yin and yang 
components and in electricity there are positive and negative charges, and 
magnets, including the Earth itself, have north and south magnetic poles which can 
either attract or repel. Levitation too seems to have r.n opposing phenomenon, 
called excessive gravitation (Melton, 2001, p.910), which fastens people to the 
ground rather than lifting them up, although it is not clear whether this is the 
levitation force working in the opposite direction or a different PK force. These 
similarities suggest that, rather than being a completely different type of energy, 
levitation and other psi phenomena may be linked to an unknown aspect of 
electromagnetism. Electromagnetism is one of the body's major forces (Smith & 
Best, 1990; Taylor, 1976); for example, nerve impulses within the brain and the 


--- Page 228 ---

body consist of "a travelling wave of chemical and electrical changes" (Lafferty & 
Rowe, 1994, p.400). Home (1863/1972) writes th3t while levitating "I usually 
experience in my body no particular sensations than what I can only describe as an 
electric fullness about the feet" (p.39). Danaos (2000) observes that when Master 
Chang passes his chi through other people it feels to them like a powerful electric 
shock, but that on a meter it "displayed neither voltage nor amperage" (p.17). 
Nevertheless, there appears to be some connection with electromagnetism 
because, as Chang claims, "I can withstand household electrical current indefinitely 
without pain, but I cannot light up a light bulb" (p.17). Paranormal researchers 
have noted that psi phenomena appear to flatten or short-circuit batteries used in 
recording equipment (Heath, 2003, p.17). Swanson (2003) reports that research 
into people with PK abilities, including healers and qigong masters, has shown that 
they can "generate very large voltages in their body, and to project beams of 
'charge' several feet away" (p.68). This force often seemed to originate from energy 
centres such as the second chakra or the dantien (Tiller, 1997). Wilson (1981, 
p.361) notes that various types of psi phenomena, including poltergeist activity, 
frequently have an electromagnetic component and, as mentioned earlier (Section 
5.5), abductees often develop Electrical Sensitive Syndrome. Several researchers 
(Evans, 1989; Gaddis, 1968; Shallis, 1988) have noted that throughout history 
there have been people with bizarre abilities that seem to be related to 
electromagnetism, such as the capacity to make metal objects stick to their bodies 
(Harvey-Wilson, 2002, p.33). Budden (1995,1998) asserts that UFO close 
encounters and abductions are produced by people's sensitivity to powerful 
electromagnetic fields, and Persinger (eg: Persinger & Cameron, 1986) is frequently 
quoted as having demonstrated a connection between electromagnetic fields and 
the experience of anomalous events. John Hutchinson has shown that by 
combining a large array of electromagnetic devices he can occasionally produce 
what appear to be psi phenomena, including the levitation of heavy objects. The 
nature of these events is unpredictable and human levitation has not occurred, but 
the Hutchinson Effect closely resembles many of the events found in poltergeist 
activity (Budden, 1998, p.62). This might seem to imply that some psi events are 
caused by a form of electromagnetism, although Cook (2002, p.386) points out that 
the Effect is probably enhanced by Hutchinson's unconscious PK abilities. Irwin 
(2004, p.133) reports that there are several objections to psi being mediated solely 
by electromagnetism. For example, psi does not seem to obey the inverse square 
law and Faraday cages do not inhibit experimental subjects' psi abilities. 


--- Page 229 ---

220 
There are several possible explanations for the occasional similarities between 
electromagnetism and psi events. Some events may be caused by 
electromagnetism while others are not, or an unknown energy may exist that at 
times resembles electromagnetism. Another possibility is that whatever causes psi 
events may somehow transcend the four basic forces of physics. In other words, 
whatever lies behind psi energy may be capable of mimicking, distorting, or 
overriding one or more of the four basic forces of physics in order to achieve its 
goal. This matches the earlier suggestion (see Chapter 5) that, despite their varying 
nature, all psi phenomena are caused by the same underlying force and/or 
intelligence. After reviewing the extraordinary abilities demonstrated by advanced 
martial arts practitioners such as Aikido's Morihei Uyeshiba, and the opinions of the 
Jesuit para psychologist Father Oscar Gonzalez Quevedo, Dr Glen Barclay (1973) 
hypothesises that whatever force is being used by these people "really cannot be 
purely physical in its nature or origin, although the effect of its operation in the 
physical universe is apparently subject to some limitations by physical factors" 
(p.127). Although it may be related to the four normal energies, the psi force seems 
to be the product of a non-local domain that contains a mixture of consciousness 
and undifferentiated energy, which is accessible using ASCs, and which seems able 
to sustain spiritual entities. A more precise description of this realm is not possible 
until science can better define consciousness and the transpersonal material or 
field that appears to sustain it beyond the body. Nevertheless it appears that a 
future definition of this levitation-facilitating realm will have to blend energy and 
information-processing concepts in a manner that science currently does not 
understand. As discussed later, researchers such as Laszlo (1996, 2004) have 
proposed that the zero point field may satisfy these criteria. 
Psychokinesis. Modern para psychological research concentrates largely on micro-
PK, such as the capacity to affect computerised random number generators (Jahn & 
Dunne, 1987; Radin, 1997), whereas levitation is classified as macro-PK. To date, 
no evidence has been produced that micro- and macro-PK use different energies, 
although it is possible that they do. When PK is used to influence a line on a 
computer screen, to bend a piece of metal, to heal someone at a distance, or 
control the weather, an invisible force seems to be acting at a distance, whereas 
levitation is something that occurs to one's own body, but the energy involved may 
be the same. As in poltergeist activity and spirit possession, it is unclear whether 
the levitation force is external (spirits) or internal (unconscious PK powers). 


--- Page 230 ---

221 
However, if human consciousness interfaces with a spirit or transpersonal realm, 
these are not two different explanations but merely different ends of the same 
spectrum. Some levitation examples seem more complex; for example, where does 
the force come from when someone is put into a trance and is seemingly levitated 
by another person, as in animal magnetism (Section 7.2)? It is unlikely that the 
levitation force is different from that used in other PK events because to say this 
implies that there are several unknown forces that, science has failed to discover. 
The fact that there do not seem to be any psi abilities that belong uniquely to only 
one of the seven groups suggests that all these people are accessing the same 
undifferentiated PK power which can be directed into different tasks. In other 
words, entranced animal magnetism subjects and a levitating lama may be raised 
by the same energy acting in a slightly different way. The way psi abilities can blend 
with each other (eg: levitation and teleportation) and with normal physical abilities 
(as in the martial arts) suggests that the PK force naturally penetrates or resonates 
with human biology. Any research breakthrough into the link between PK, energy, 
consciousness and matter may therefore help explain human levitation. 
Information. One theory to explain PK, which may therefore apply to levitation, 
involves the concept of information. Some parapsychologists have suggested that, 
when experimental subjects appear to use PK to bias the output of random-number-
generators, what is happening is that "the random bits are being mentally forced to 
change from purely random to more orderly" (Radin, 1997, p.279). In other words, 
information is somehow being inserted into an otherwise random system. Radin 
(1997) explains that "what seems to be happening in mind-matter interaction 
phenomena is better described in terms of exchanges of information rather than by 
the application of conventional forces" (p.279). To help explain the origin of this 
theory, Jahn (1995) notes that early science progressed from an interest in physical 
mass to the concept of energy, but that "over the past few decades, a third physical 
currency, information, has taken centre stage, and clearly will dominate basic 
science and its applications over the foreseeable future" (p.400). One of the 
historical problems with theories that purport to explain the unknown is that they 
often reflect the dominant scientific concepts of the time and are soon discarded 
when a more sophisticated concept emerges. Davies (1999) notes that "history 
provides examples where a concept from technology has been projected onto 
nature and used to construct a cosmology" (p.3). For example, the invention of 
computers has introduced the notion of "nature itself being a computational 


--- Page 231 ---

222 
process" (p.3). Davies warns that, although such metaphors may be accurate in 
some ways, they do not describe physical reality precisely. This warning is relevant 
to levitation research because throughout this study the term 'energy' has been 
used to describe the hypothetical levitation force. But, although it might indeed be 
an unknown energy, the term could mislead researchers into thinking that it must 
comply with science's understanding of how conventional energy forces operate, 
whereas it may in fact work quite differently. 
The dominant theory proposed by members of the seven groups is that levitation is 
caused by a non-local spiritual energy from another realm or dimension. Smith & 
Best (1990, p.258) point out that, because energy is required for one material 
system to influence another, an explanation is needed for the proposals that 
"knowledge, or information, has an objective existence outside the constraints of 
space and time and [that] it is possible for a system to become more ordered as the 
result of an input of information" (p.258). In other words, they aie saying that if PK 
events such as levitation are to be explained as the insertion of the appropriate 
information into a physical system, "it must be possible to enter into the world of 
physics from outside time and space without any energy requirements" (p.258). 
Attempting to explain PK in informational terms can be seen as a technical version 
of the perennial mystical claim that consciousness somehow underlies physical 
reality. If this theory has some validity, the way a person psychokinetically inserts 
information into an internal (eg: levitation) or external (eg: healing) physical system 
may be via ASCs. This is similar to the suggestion made by Transcendental 
Meditation (TM) practitioners and others that deep meditation enables a person to 
access a unified field which can facilitate psi events. Many psi abilities seem to 
reveal that, at a deeper level, some aspect of human consciousness can move 
beyond the constraints of space and time into a transpersonal or non-local realm. 
However, even if this is how psi events occur, it does not explain the nature of the 
energy involved. As Hasted writes: 
In the dualistic approach which we favour, a mind is capable of 
operating according to its own laws, without these being determined 
mechanically by the laws of physics. Only the interface must conform 
to physical laws, and it is this interface which we are investigating in 
parapsychology and psychic research. (Hasted, 1981, p.248) 
Despite what Hasted thinks, the proposed interface between mind and matter may 
not conform to conventional physical laws, so researchers should perhaps not make 
this assumption unless they find evidence to confirm it.

223 
Spirits, Consciousness and Energy. The spiritual energy theory that emerges from 
the thematic comparison suggests that levitation is caused by powers that originate 
within a non-physical, spiritual realm that is accessible by certain ASCs. This theory 
is similar to Radin's (1997, p.255) transcendental monism and Woodhouse's 
(2001, p.232) consciousness and energy monism, because with minor variations all 
three theories suggest that physical matter and energy originate from, and/or are 
controlled by, a transcendent source that is primarily composed of consciousness. 
In general terms this theory can be called the open model of the human mind, 
which assumes that the mind has at least two levels: a physical level that operates 
within the biological brain and is therefore limited to a particular time and place, 
and a transcendent or mystical level which is non-physical and non-local and which 
most people only learn about when they have an OBE, NDE, or at death itself. It 
seems that many members of the seven groups, unlike the average person, are 
interested in learning to access this higher level of consciousness because of its 
remarkable potential. They believe that at this level all minds are connected, 
forming or interfacing with a multi-dimensional spiritual realm in which 
consciousness and energy merge or interact, thus facilitating psi phenomena. 
Sometimes called 'the perennial philosophy', this theory has been advocated by 
numerous writers and mystics (eg: Bucke, 1901/1969; Maharaj, 1984; Wilber, 
1985), although most of them seem to regard its psi implications as irrelevant. This 
realm supposedly interfaces with the physical world at all levels, hence Evelyn 
Underbill's (1915/n.d.) definition of mysticism as "the art of union with Reality" 
(p.3). 'Reality' in this sense appears to include all visible physical matter, as well as 
generally invisible phenomena such as energy, consciousness and whatever else 
exists that the average person cannot detect. The existence of this interface 
between mystical consciousness and reality may help explain why some group 
members can communicate with or control animals, fire and the weather. ASCs are 
found in all seven groups because they seem to be needed to access this realm. 
Unfortunately, this theory contains so many unsubstantiated components that a 
scientist who wanted to investigate the matter would probably not know where to 
begin his or her research. Most researchers who debate whether spirit possession 
and poltergeist activity are caused by internal or external forces do not subscribe to 
the perennial philosophy, whereas for shamans, mystics, Spiritualists, advanced 
qigong practitioners and many alien abductees, most of its claims are fundamental 
to their beliefs. Within these groups, the question of whether psi events are caused 


--- Page 233 ---

224 
by internal or external forces is generally resolved by the assertion that 
consciousness can transcend the physical body and by the claim that the 
personification of spiritual forces is largely for convenience or symbolic. For 
example, as Blofeld (1974) explains, Tibetan Buddhist spiritual entities are seen as 
"symbolic representations of the phantasmagoria that haunts the threshold of 
human consciousness" (p.38). Personifying ubiquitous spiritual forces may help 
believers relate to them but it seems to confuse many researchers, although 
advanced practitioners from the groups seem able to transcend these conflicting 
explanations. Shamans talk about spirits yet acknowledge that they have to go 
within themselves to access the forces they need to carry out psi tasks. Mystics 
from all religions speak of omnipresent gods and spirits yet go inwards to access 
them or, as with tulpas, to create them. Spiritualists believe in spirits, but also 
describe 'spirit' as a ubiquitous and intelligent psi force. Some alien abductees are 
accused of being deluded or possessed (internal forces) while others assert that 
aliens are independent, multidimensional beings. Aliens can sometimes be 
contacted using seances and, as with shamans, abduction experiences may occur 
during dreams or visionary experiences. Some advanced qigong practitioners 
believe in spirits, but most describe chi as a transcendent, universal life energy that 
exists all around and within us. Rather than arguing about the internal or external 
source of spiritual or psi forces, what we seem to have here is the problem of 
defining the boundaries of human consciousness. A person who believes that 
human consciousness cannot transcend the brain will probably regard spirits as 
external or deny that they exist at all, while those who believe that consciousness is 
not limited to the physical brain may accept that spiritual entities or forces can be 
accessed by going inwards, yet may still describe them as transcendent. The fact 
that most members of the seven groups adopt the latter perspective suggests that 
further impartial research into ASCs and the open model of the human mind will 
probably yield answers about how levitation and other psi abilities work. 
Subtle Energies. When John Keel (1957) asked Nyang-Pas if he could teach him 
how to levitate, the lama replied "It is not something you can learn overnight. It is a 
matter of will" (p.186). Nyang-Pas does not explain exactly what he means by this, 
but the farmer Mikhail Drogzenovich (in Chapter 4) also claimed that he uses will-
power to levitate. As discussed in that section, if the term will-power is used to refer 
to person's voluntary psi ability — for example a qigong master who can throw an 
opponent backwards with no physical contact (Dong & Raffill, 1996) — it appears 


--- Page 234 ---

225 
that most people would require considerable meditative or consciousness training 
to achieve such will-power. This raises the question of what precisely it is within 
such a person that is being strengthened. This research appears to reveal that 
what is happening with such practitioners is that they are strengthening their 
capacity to focus their minds or consciousness while in an ASC. This reflects the 
claim that human beings appear to have access to a hierarchy of energies that may 
facilitate psi phenomena as well as normal physical activities. At the top is 
conscious decision making or will-power and, although it is the most subtle and its 
energy may currently be hard to detect, it seems capable of directing other more 
conventional and detectable energies such as those used by human muscles. 
Some parapsychologists use the term 'downward causation' (Radin, 1997, p.260) 
to describe this proposed hierarchy of effects, and, although this idea offers no 
empirical explanation for levitation, it does acknowledge that even someone who 
can deliberately levitate may be unaware of what energy is involved further down 
the hierarchy, or how it works. Despite many years of meditative training, all the 
levitator may know is how to focus his or her will-power sufficiently while in a 
particular ASC. In other cases the actual energetic mechanism that facilitates 
levitation may be able to function unconsciously or independently of human 
conscious control, which might explain why some levitators prefer to claim that 
spirits are involved. Some researchers are currently investigating what they term 
'subtle energies' on the assumption that there probably exist levels of conventional 
energies or new types of non-local energies that are beyond the range of current 
.'scientific measuring devices. Many are seeking subtle energies in healing (eg: 
Dossey, 1999; Gerber, 2001). None are investigating levitation but, as this 
research has shown, the same psi power may be involved in both phenomena. 
Shamans are primarily healers and also sometimes levitate. Joseph of Cupertino 
once healed a nobleman by levitating him. Chi energy can be used to heal people 
and for levitation. Most books on chi are about healing rather than psi abilities. 
Jahnke (2002) discusses the possible connections between modern physics and 
subtle energies such as chi. Mack (2000a) discusses subtle energies in detail, as 
' does Gruber (1999, p.166). Although these researchers are not concentrating on 
human levitation, because psi energy appears to be undifferentiated at its most 
fundamental level, any discoveries made by these and other investigators about 
subtle energies may also help explain levitation.

226 
Brain Coherence and Zero Point Energy. In recent years the assertion that 
consciousness accesses an unknown realm or field that facilitates psi abilities has 
been described in several ways: as the unified field (Hagelin, 1987), as the 
holographic paradigm (Talbot, 1991), as the zero point field (McTaggart, 2001) and 
as the synchronized universe (Swanson, 2003). These theories may largely be 
describing the same phenomena, but it is beyond the scope of this research project 
to review all their supposed scientific justifications. Instead, this section will 
summarise the claims about brain coherence and the zero point field, and note 
their similarities with the perennial philosophy. Swanson (2003) claims that "the 
synchronization of the various fields and biological systems of the body may be a 
key to understanding PK" (p.68). Synchronization or coherence refers to a large 
number of brain cells or body energies working in unison, which apparently 
increases their combined power considerably. Physicists also use the term 
coherence with regard to non-biological energies working in unison. An example of 
the increased power produced by coherence is the difference between torch beams, 
which use incoherent, out-of-phase light, and laser beams which use coherent, in-
phase light. The Transcendental Meditation (TM) organization has for years claimed 
that EEG studies (eg: Orme-Johnson & Haynes, 1981) have shown that when 
practitioners' bodies lift off the ground while hopping around - which they call 'yogic 
flying' (see Section 7.7) - their brain wave activity shows a maximum level of 
coherence (TM-Sidhi Program, 2001). The TM research does not specifically focus 
on a correlation between PK and brain coherence, but they do claim that yogic flying 
is a precursor to human levitation, which might suggest that an even higher level of 
brain coherence could produce levitation. 
Swanson (2003, p.269) claims that the psi effect of a number of brain cells working 
in unison increases by the square of their combined individual power. If this is true, 
it could mean that an appropriate degree of brain coherence could produce a 
noticeable psi result whereas those same cells working incoherently would not. 
Swanson (p.271) also claims that deep meditation increases the degree of brain 
synchronization, thus facilitating psi abilities which cannot be achieved in normal 
consciousness. Religious rapture and shamanic ecstasy may be symptoms of brain 
coherence, which might explain why so many mystics and shamans levitate while in 
these ASCs. A phenomenological equivalent of brain coherence may be found in 
the traditional advice that meditation practitioners should learn to still the 
background chatter within their minds, which is often done by focussing on a 


--- Page 236 ---

227 
mantra to exclude other mental activity. As mentioned previously (in Chapter 4), 
this training significantly increases the signal to noise ratio between what one is 
concentrating on (signal) and background mental activity (noise). When advanced 
practitioners focus, for example, on a desire to levitate it is probable that their 
consciousness has a much higher degree of coherence than someone who has no 
such training. Rebecca singing with her friends (Section 4.5) may have produced 
sufficient coherence to enable her briefly to walk on water. If coherence can 
significantly increase normal bodily energies, it is possible that some psi events are 
not an unknown energy but a normal biological energy that has been temporarily 
increased in power through synchronization. For example, it has been found that 
some energy healers and qigong masters can produce electrical voltages in parts of 
their bodies that are up to ten thousand times higher than normal (Swanson, 2003, 
p.69). Jahn's (1995, p.402) reference to one of his successful mind-machine PK 
subjects resonating or falling in love with the machine suggests that the mind can 
also become coherent with an external object. Coherence, however, does not 
explain how some psi phenomena appear to override the normal laws of physics. 
Dr Ervin Laszlo (1996) explains that the zero point field is to be found in the 
quantum vacuum which is defined as what remains "when all other, more 
conventional forms of energy vanish" (p.180). This field underlies the entire 
universe and was the source of what is colloquially known as the Big Bang. All the 
energy and matter in the current universe supposedly originates from this source. 
Zero point energies "are the very source of the electromagnetic, gravitational, and 
nuclear forces of the cosmos" (Laszlo, 1996, p.180). Physicists claim that energy 
can be obtained from this field provided it is stimulated in an appropriate fashion 
(Cook, 2002, p.336). Laszlo (1996) notes that the energy density of the zero point 
field is apparently astronomically greater than anything within the known universe, 
so "the observable universe floats, as it were, on its surface" (p.181). Laszlo 
explains that a group of Russian physicists has produced a "torsion-field theory of 
the physical vacuum" which claims that "all objects, from particles to galaxies, 
create vortices in the vacuum. The vortices created by particles and other material 
objects are information carriers, linking physical events quasi-instantaneously" 
(p.187), because 'torsion-waves' move within this realm considerably faster than 
the speed of light. Laszlo (1996) points out that because "the neurones in our 
brain create and receive torsion-waves, it is not only particles that are 'informed' of 
each other's presence ... but also humans" (p..l87). This, he believes, can begin to 


--- Page 237 ---

228 
explain ESP abilities and the non-local qualities of sub-atomic particles. "In the 
emerging vision living organisms are linked with one another, interrelated by the 
holographically information-conserving and -transmitting field that pervades the 
universe. They all communicate together, dance the cosmic dance with each other" 
(Laszlo, 1996, p.206). If these claims about this "vacuum-based holofield" (p.214) 
are true, tuning in to this zero point field using ASCs may facilitate ESP. Laszlo does 
not discuss PK in any detail. If this realm mirrors every aspect of normal biological 
consciousness and is the source of all forms of energy, accessing it appropriately 
may enable the mind to control some of that energy. This might explain why the 
various psi abilities mentioned in Chapter 5 suggest the existence of an underlying, 
undifferentiated energy that not only seems to be related to electromagnetism and 
gravity but also possesses a form of intelligence. Furthermore, Laszlo (1996) says 
that if the zero point field reacts to and permanently records everything that occurs 
within our brains, "our consciousness may be, in a sense, immortal" (p.215). This 
could mean that physicists may eventually find themselves validating the existence 
of independent, non-physical bundles of consciousness that have traditionally been 
called spirits. These zero-point ideas reflect the perennial philosophy and various 
mystical claims in several ways. For example, Buddhism claims that the ultimate, 
undifferentiated state of consciousness is the Void, which, rather than being empty, 
constantly sustains reality in a "boundless flux" (Blofeld, 1974, p.62). What some 
Christian mystics call the Godhead might also be a reference to the zero point 
realm. As Laszlo (1996) writes, "Matter and mind are both real but they are not 
fundamental: they evolved together out of a still deeper level of reality. The roots of 
both matter and mind extend into a deeper layer of reality that in itself is neither 
mental nor material" (p.207). 
This theory suggests that those who can levitate at will have learnt to access or 
merge with what one could call the mirror image or echo of their biological 
consciousness that exists within this realm, thus gaining partial or temporary control 
of whatever forces underlie gravity and electromagnetism. This might also help 
explain the mystical instruction about the need to still one's biological mind in order 
to access the non-local, transcendent level of consciousness. This might mean that 
the nature of the energy used by levitators who hover differs slightly from those who 
fly a specific trajectory, but both are using ASCs as a method of control. Those who 
levitate entranced subjects may put them into coherent ASCs to facilitate access to 
whatever energy is needed. If spirits exist within this realm, they may act as 


--- Page 238 ---

229 
beacons for physical mediums to resonate with to achieve the requisite degree of 
brain coherence to produce psi effects. In brief, the zero point theory can be 
combined with the idea of brain coherence to suggest that, because normal brain 
activity only perturbs the zero point field to a minor extent, ASCs are needed to 
produce enough brain coherence to facilitate psi effects such as human levitation. 
However, as Swanson (2003, p.235) points out, although zero point energy is an 
integral part of modern quantum mechanics theory, most mainstream physicists 
have no interest in its possible connection to psi phenomena. This means that at 
this stage this hypothesis about how human levitation might work is a mixture of 
scientific fact and informed speculation, so more research from a variety of fields is 
needed before it can be confirmed. 
Summary. Each part of this hypothesis-generation section seems to point towards 
an open model of the human mind which asserts that consciousness is capable of 
transcending the biological brain. Mainstream science largely adopts the theory of 
materialistic monism which claims that "matter causes mind, that the mind is 
essentially a function of the activity of matter in the brain. The basic stuff of the 
universe is matter and energy" (Radin, 1997, p.255j. But this limited model can 
only be accepted if numerous psi anomalies are ignored or rejected. The beliefs of 
the seven groups examined in this thesis would make more sense, and psi 
phenomena would be more easily explained, if an open model of the mind were 
correct, but at this stage the theory has not Been verified conclusively despite 
having been in existence for several thousand years. In general terms the groups' 
beliefs and their anecdotal psi reports postulate the existence of a multi-
dimensional realm or field that interfaces or interpenetrates our physical universe. 
The hypothesised qualities of this realm are that it stores information in a non-local 
manner, and appears capable of controlling or overriding what physicists claim are 
the four basic forces of nature. The human brain is believed to be an interface 
device between this realm of transpersonal consciousness and physical reality. The 
realm only seems accessible using certain ASCs. Because of their lack of 
appropriate training, and possibly their genetic inheritance, most people, therefore, 
do not seem to have voluntary or conscious access to this realm. As the thematic 
comparison reveals, the activities and beliefs of all seven groups contain elements 
of mysticism, which can be seen as the art of attempting to transcend these 
barriers. The belief that certain people can transcend the physical body to access 
this realm assumes that humans have a soul or spirit, but, as Braude (2003, p.292) 


--- Page 239 ---

230 
asks, what is the nature of the 'stuff' that survives death? This research cannot 
answer that question but, if this realm is able to sustain clairvoyant information, 
spirits, Taoist immortals, tulpas and other seemingly intelligent entities, then, to use 
computing terminology, it would surely need to be composed of a substance that 
has highly sophisticated information storage and processing capacities. In addition, 
if this realm can facilitate human levitation and other PK phenomena, it would need 
to contain large amounts of energy and the capacity to create, dematerialize and 
teleport matter, as well as being connected to human consciousness. As 
Woodhouse (2001) puts it, "All things emerge from and are sustained by a common 
source, which may be labelled in various ways" (p.232). In his opinion this source 
"is neither just consciousness nor just energy, but transcends and includes the very 
distinction between them" (p.232). Laszlo (1993,1995,1996, 2003, 2004) 
continually reviews the scientific evidence for the existence of such a field although 
he does not discuss its connection with PK. Nevertheless, at present, the 
suggested link between brain coherence and the zero point field appears to be the 
most promising research hypothesis to explain human levitation and other psi 
phenomena. 
8.3 Suggestions for Future Research. 
This study has demonstrated that research topics most closely related to psi 
abilities such as human levitation are PK, the transpersonal or other-dimensional 
nature of ASCs, forces such as chi or prana and phenomena such as brain 
coherence and zero point energy. For example, are chi and the zero point field the 
same source of psi energy and, if so, does brain coherence help access it? Some of 
these topics are harder to research than others, but some have an empirical nature 
that can be investigated fairly easily. Finding and suitably documenting someone 
who can levitate voluntarily, or involuntarily using hypnosis or mesmerism, would 
demonstrate that the phenomenon exists, but it would not necessarily explain how 
it works. Measuring the levitator's brain patterns might reveal that the energy 
involved or the relevant aspect of consciousness requires more advanced scientific 
equipment and concepts than are currently available. During this research I 
interviewed six people who claimed to have levitated, but all of them said it was 
spontaneous and involuntary, so were unable to provide a demonstration. Four of 
them claimed that someone witnessed them levitating but, because the events 
occurred several years ago and/or in different parts of Australia, I have been unable 
to confirm any of the reports. None of them could explain why they levitated on that

particular occasion and not at some other time. Nevertheless, it seems that the 
best research idea is to find someone who can levitate at will, but, failing that, the 
following suggestions may also help us understand the phenomenon. 
1) Chi. According to Danaos (2000; 2002), qigong is one of the most precise 
techniques for developing and investigating PK abilities. Numerous researchers are 
investigating the healing effects of chi, but only a few discuss its link with PK 
(Barclay, 1973; Danaos, 2000,2002; Dong & Raffill, 1996,1997; Swanson, 2003; 
Tiller, 1997). Further research into the paranormal aspect of chi, which is 
supposedly being carried out by the Chinese government (Gruber, 1999, p.124), 
may produce useful information about levitation and other psi abilities. 
2) Spiritualism. Although they are timely and bold, the investigations into life-
after-death and the nature of spirits by Schwartz (2002) and Braude (2003) do not 
set out to explain their connection to psi or PK phenomena. In the course of this 
levitation study, eleven Spiritualists, ten Christian priests and pastors and nine 
qigong instructors were interviewed (see Appendix). The Spiritualist sample 
produced three levitators and three levitation witnesses; one of the Catholic pastors 
claims to have levitated; and two of the qigong instructors have witnessed someone 
levitate. In addition I interviewed an abductee (Laura) who claims to have levitated, 
and Alison who says she levitated twice during yoga classes. This suggests that 
human levitation is more common than parapsychologists appear to believe. 
Levitation probably occurs most often among Spiritualists because they deliberately 
attempt to interact with spiritual forces and entities, and normally welcome psi 
phenomena as confirmation of their belief in an afterlife. All the interviewees come 
from Perth, Western Australia, which has a population of nearly one and a half 
million, only a small percentage of whom are priests, pastors, Spiritualists, or qigong 
teachers. This suggests that worldwide there may be many people who have either 
levitated or seen someone do it, but whose experiences have not been publicised or 
researched. Spiritualism may thus be the best field for future levitation researchers 
to investigate. Night-vision goggles can overcome the problem of unlit seances, or, 
as the medium Edward reports (in Section 2.3), several experienced mediums could 
deliberately attempt to levitate someone under normal lighting conditions. 
3) The Lifting Game. Although the lifting game does not produce full levitation, it 
seems to involve mass control, so, by using appropriate weighing devices, this 


--- Page 241 ---

232 
technique may easily produce confirmation that something anomalous, that seems 
to be a precursor to full levitation, does exist. By monitoring the lifters and sitter 
appropriately it may also be possible to investigate the connection between the 
lifting game and brain coherence. Such an experiment would be inexpensive and 
would not require trained subjects, although stronger results might be obtained if 
experienced meditators or qigong practitioners were used as sitters and lifters. 
Mass control could also be investigated without using the lifting game. It would be 
easy to design an experiment to discover if some people can really reduce their 
weight merely by concentrating. Sensitive weighing devices linked to a computer 
could be used and hypnotised subjects, advanced meditators, martial arts 
practitioners, or people who claim to possess psi abilities would be ideal subjects. 
Even if they only briefly lost a small percent of their weight, a scientific explanation 
would be needed. Is this the levitation force at work, and if the person keeps 
practising to increase the percentage, will he or she eventually rise off the ground? 
4) Hypnosis, Animal Magnetism and Mesmerism. To investigate reports of 
somnambulistic or magnetised subjects levitating, it would not be difficult to employ 
an experienced practitioner of these arts to test various subjects to see if they lift 
off the ground or lose weight when in an appropriately deep trance. Hypnotists 
claim that only a small percentage of subjects can be put into a somnambulistic 
trance, so these are probably the ones that should be tested. Other suitable 
subjects would be advanced meditators, martial arts practitioners who are sensitive 
to chi, people who claim to have psi abilities, or some alien abductees. 
5) The God of Gravity? The example of the orphan who trained himself to link his 
consciousness with the 'god behind the flame' in order to gain fire immunity 
(Gaddis, 1968, p. 110); Long's (1954, p.356) report about Hawaiian kahunas 
communicating with the High Self of the weather; and Shah's (1956/1973, p.141) 
comments about the spirit guarding that law of gravity, illustrate that, with 
appropriate training, some people can access spiritual entities or universal energies 
that can confer certain psi abilities. If children are more open to this training than 
adults, it may be possible to conduct an experiment in which young subjects 
attempt to sense the god or power behind the weight of a small object. If they can 
tune into this spiritual force they may be able to levitate the object and eventually 
perhaps themselves.
